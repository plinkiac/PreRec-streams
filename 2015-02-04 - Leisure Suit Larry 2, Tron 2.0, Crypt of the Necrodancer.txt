that was terrifying
oh my god our own ad nearly deafened me
worse I was in TV playing the the sound
is that we're like it shouldn't be
what's coming the video I guess my
graphics card is able to handle sound
for when you plug it into a TV it's nice
let's say to see mine I never hear sound
on my own TV at home
I don't know any the remote we're trying
to sound out on TV cuz that's gonna
happen again

- huh dads
yeah we have to suffer through ads um if
we want to watch this dream also who
would linked us to a woman is afraid of
owls that was the dumbest SNL sketch
I've ever seen that was really awful you
know sometimes there's that setup where
you know what the punchline is gonna be
but it still catches you by surprise
yeah I mean when the joke is only
somebody just kind of losing their shit
running around and breaking things and
tripping over the oh that's the function
Oh Oh like oh sure that's great I loved

also professor pun thank you for
subscribing
we very much appreciate it because it's
definitely clicked as bang on that's not
shown up it's not shown up why is it not
shown up it's weird hearing me on on
like a 30-second delay in my headphones
yeah I'm excited for the game to start

Suit Larry - right and Darth meringue
geez dark place thank you for
subscribing
we very much appreciate it and I also
enjoyed Darth meringue geez Garth
Maggie's dark place um you see that one
ah our Crime $29.99 thank you for
subscribing
we really appreciate it it's true we
very much do hey this is Leisure Suit
Larry - yeah we're it's an adventure
game we are playing it because it is I
believe the only classic Sierra parser
adventure game that I haven't played and
parser is is different from the
point-and-click I actually have to type
in what your character does I assumed
this was a point-and-click and it is not
no it is a parser which using context
clues means that you type yes you like
you still use the arrow keys to move
around but like if you want to search
the cabinet you type in search cabinet
and then if you want to use an item you
have to actually describe what you do
with it you don't just like click
randomly on the screen until something
happens love it you have to think about
how you use the things you have I enter
odd you love that also Questor fest
thank you for subscribing these past
four months
so okay now because this is an old game
yeah this is this is ancient DRM yes see
back in the day they could not stop you
from just handing your copy of a game to
a friend and letting them install it and
then giving you the discs back and one
person could buy the game and twenty
people in the neighborhood could have it
right you couldn't I don't know if it
was hard to share it over the internet
back then but there was still piracy yes
so while the the actual copies of the
game were easy to make and pass around
hmm they figured the hand books were a
little bit more difficult to duplicate
yes so what they did was they they had
like information that you had to verify
in the handbook before the game would
start so so we have like a little PDF
file that I I generally I bought this
off of GOG calm how strange
yes this is a other than this handbook
DRM this is a a DRM free game that I
have bought off of Gog and it comes with
a PDF file that's got the old manual so
I'm looking at PDF file of a pages from
the book where it's got pictures of
different girls and their phone numbers
and what is her number seven four four
eight seven four four if I need to click
in the window right bingo
okay okay also yeah Oh give him four
four get the mouse out of there H damn
mom will give me a second jack and mouse
out of there well that's actually kind
of part of the game too you might be
able to click on things here in there oh
it's it's like this they're starting
when they made this they're starting to
move towards play sure sure so there is
some point and click functionality great
all right we're starting
Leisure Suit Larry goes looking for love
animist primal thank you for subscribing
in several wrong places and I'll just
get through a little okay

saw on out of the corner of my eye it
looked like Larry took a header that's
titled I would believe that this is what
are all these balls delightful you make
any sense

I don't think we're hearing the game
music in the stream well we are not
hearing the game music extreme oh well

to cook it'll be okay sorry everybody a
rich doesn't want to figure it out yet

penthouse apartment in the land of first

is a game-ending fuckup
do you want us to tell you is what the
chat is asking I mean if it's a
game-ending fuckup
what do you think what do you think rich
we made it through I think I think save
frequently I made it through Space Quest
yeah it took a couple days but I knew
about game-ending fuck-ups though I
think I steered away you Stevie like
like for example if anyone was was here
for the Space Quest adventure I got
really stuck at a couple times like I
got really stuck in the ship yeah so if
there's something that we are super
stuck on um then let us know that is
what I was saying all right all right
I mean well and we'll tell you guys will
say you guys tell us you know what's
going up sir apparently I can't spell
calendar look Kel and dirty ale see ya
Yin D yeah I think it's a are you think

well then we just left the barbershop
and now we are in the slightly seedy
section of the city by the seashore
possibly he's true it's what she sells
okay Jay is working and so I have his
mic down at the time but if he wants to
say anything I will turn up his
microphone and he will talk to you but
let the man work I'm doing visual
effects
say that again Jay I'm doing visual
effects there you go six hours some
three seconds of the movie
that's how movies working yeah here's my
piece of advice for aspiring filmmakers
yeah don't make a movie that has visual
effects in every shot of your film
unless you're George Lucas don't do it
great weight avoid sprawling science
fiction epics let's go get somebody else
oh yeah if you have a team of like
seventy-five to a hundred visual
sardis then I would say go for it what
what movie was that we were watching and
we got to the end credits and the visual
effects it was like some brick of text
like the whole screen was metal that's
every movie now especially Marvel it was
a Marvel movie I know but well they're
all like that and in the Iron Man 3
there was joke could be effects artists
joke 1 yeah like they they put in extra
ones oh really
maybe it was Iron Men through them
that'll fuck with people it's it's been
numerous movies now yeah and now you
understand why because you've been
trying to do them all yourself
yep great I mean I understood why before
but it was fun to make fun of them now
doesn't seem is money sure okay alright
we are now in a slightly seedy section
of the city welcome we find her

humping and every time you thrust the
dog barks yeah it'sit's pretty surreal

I love Randy Quaid we've made fun of
Randy Quaid but it's it's yeah it's kind
of sad yeah yeah and the less attention
you give it the better yes that being
said I understand completely why people

there you look by the sign on the
druggists counter you presume the
druggist is out only a clerk remains and
he doesn't look too bright by Spanish
Fly not talk to him um do you have
anything here that cost a dollar last
you ask him nope I do to do do see me

still mad I don't like anime um I'm
sorry me believe Oh Mabel Mabel is the
one that that apparently sent me an
anime care package yeah he sent both of
us an animal yeah and even though even
though I've been I've been opened with
Chad since the beginning yeah that I'm
not especially big anime fan hmm Mabel's
Mabel's was was shocked that I was
snarky I'm not receiving the enemy care
package not for one no I didn't mean to
legitimately hurt your feelings not
everything everything I say like both on
the chat and in real life is this a
little bit exaggerated a little bit
snarky sure but it's like you sent me
out of May I've been upfront about not
especially liking anime huh I don't know
that you can be upset that I wasn't
delighted ah yeah okay and and I know
not all anime is the same but like as a
generalization I don't like it um I
don't remember exactly what you said I
know you you mentioned some of them
before and I'm gonna go through some of
them Akira I believe you said you sent
Akira Hiro was in there yeah I could
appreciate the animation mm-hmm I don't
like Akira okay so I already don't like
a tear up great
uh spirited away I might be willing
spirit leave a shot any of those Mia a
Miyazaki film I've heard it's good a
great name well said he say he said
there's a couple Miyazaki ones in there
yeah see it's not thank you who sent
those Mego Gables me balls me balls
thank you for sending those I'm gonna be
appreciative here say thank you because
I want to watch the Miyazaki stuff yeah
so I watch the JJ will appreciate yeah
and I took her go home don't don't let
rich get you down we read to him it's
like I was in high school right when
anime was becoming big so it was hard
for me to completely avoid these things
yeah like vampire hunter D was something
he said he said yeah yeah he's got a
weird Fe talking head huh and he's big
serious badass or whatever whatever
cartoons bloody all of us that's
hardcore

things uh Ninja Scroll Ninja Scroll I

million-five a little steep even if
you're even if the suit is important
okay all right so the suit is a million
dollars yeah and we bought a lottery

want to play that by myself to join the
XPS and he should and I won't play
because then Jack would end up being
spoil right for everything that happens
in it so yes I'm gonna play that by
myself oh by the way update everyone on
my first world gamer problem okay which
wish system to buy for I have decided to
buy it for the computer so i bought it
on Steam I'm a steam guy so I'm just
when steam already I kind of regret it
because like I almost like I want to
play it on my Vita cuz I just have that
with me more but I accept my decision um
so why didn't you get the GOG version
cuz I like steam oh you know like you
can you can achieve us I like
achievements I like the trading cards I
like the whole thing cuz you can you can
link to a game on Steam that's not a
steam game right so you have easy access
to it I like I do with everything I like
the meta stuff alright I'm God and of
course I like the trading cards cuz then
I can get more friends you know except I
I'm not I'm now have like over 200
requests waiting in queue you have
enough force my hand yeah cuz originally
I was on the fence cuz I already own
Grim Fandango and I own programs and let
me run Grim Fandango in a modern system
yeah now I feel like I have to support
GOG cuz you didn't buy the GOG version I
I wholeheartedly support you have now
forced my hand to buy
ha ha III 100% support GOG in all of its
efforts but I like the other stuff on
Steam too
I don't know what to do now are those
clothing store that was the clothing
store so I there might no wait what
thank you know is there something with a
TV so we can here lottery results oh
maybe the drug store there's oh oh wait
the convenience store I think had
something like yeah let's go check the
convenient store dukka dukka dukka
doomed there was a soda machine well the
drug stores right here I'll check the
cards this something lottery lottery
tickets something something lottery of
course of course that's the only thing
we have right now and then the next the
next lead is the suit right um no
there's nothing in the drugstore let's
go see what this sale bin is look sign
of the draw all right look in bin you
can't do that here all right
what does just say no means the drugs
drugs well the drug I know I thought
that Mike

[Part II]
boys admire southern girls okay
hand over ticket you're gonna compliment
her I don't think we can how are you
gonna get the ladies if you don't
compliment them
this game isn't many I have no idea what
are you doing in this game because I
walk in here with a five million dollar
soup she's gonna instantly fall in love
with us okay so I'm giving the women of
this game too much credit no while
you're giving the writers of this game
too much yes let's see how they write
their writers of the women characters
the writers of the women um okay you are
you saying that there aren't women out
there who are attracted to that kind of
thing money and power are you saying
like I'm not saying there isn't and
that's a generalization I'm sure it's
wrong I know what you're saying is that
any woman in this game if you have a 5
million i'm sued they're gonna get with
you i'm saying that presumably this
woman might okay then
she works in a convenience store
somebody walks in with a five million
dollar suit that's her that's her ticket
out of the convenience okay fair enough
I don't think I can give her and say the
woman who works at the store that sells
the five million dollars it's probably
not the same thing
sure okay I am Keith David thank you for
subscribing we really appreciate it
now we need someone to subscribe it's
named I am David Keith because those are
both actors I'd be attracted to a woman
who was wearing a five million dollar
dress how would you know it's a five
million dollar dress I'm assuming if you
spend five million dollars on it it's
gonna look fucking great all right you
know what TV station huh TV station oh

think was TV but that's right there was
a TV station

fiancee on the show that one time look
at wall she kind of wants to come back
at some point she wants to play monster
was it monster party then this one yeah
watch me not remember hey speaking of
samurai cop - what do you guys think
about self-aware sequels - lousy movies
they're usually better yeah it's it's
generally a bad idea
I don't know funny one Essene hobgoblins
- that was made because the first
Hobgoblin goblins was on Mystery Science
Theater and it was a terrible movie so
then after the success and popularity of
it being on Mystery Science Theater the
guy decided to make a sequel and it's
like yeah you can't you can't make a
sequel to a bad movie where you're aware
that the first movie is bad and you're
trying to repeat that right it just
doesn't work it's true I I did something
right oh I showed the receptionist my
lottery ticket okay so this is what
Larry says save us perceptions this
lottery ticket any good I don't know

hahahaha congratulations mr. lapper
you're the lucky man too bad we don't

someone again won't get my balance with
this is what there can't be anything
more than that right well that's here at
Gorham ladies and gentlemen mr. larry
line for the luckiest guy in Los Angeles
you know for the last hour we haven't
done any adventure gaming this game is
kind of been on the rails
ever since the greenroom you know you
really kind of annoying and even before
that there was just like nothing - yeah
we're explore anything I'm not most
exploration but there just wasn't much
you can do figure yeah I don't think so
that's again control room talks back
girls oh good throws it all the world
that's good enough for who it's for mr.
mr. laughs fair pre will please exit
through the door to the left there will
be plenty of reporters and photographs
waiting for you
photographer is waiting for you yeah
also like I haven't need something
needed to walk anywhere it walks really
yeah I'm not liking this one gee Larry
if things are finally beginning to go
your way first you win a month-long
ocean voyage with a lovely Bachelorette
and now you now you win the biggest
lottery prize in history
something tells you this is too good to
last probably I mean they also didn't
give you a million dollar bill yeah
instead of like a jacker getting your
bank account information can I go back
to the green room and like talk to that
lady and be like I have a million
dollars now sure thing it's like I'm
gonna go back and talk to the
Bachelorette and be like why not no I
want to talk to that backstory I'd be
like okay I'm a millionaire now will you
go on the cruise with me and she'll be
like fuck yeah I will
I'll also get on your dues
philately no fear no envy says is this
what it's like watching those horrible
best of the worst movies
kind of yeah you know oh oh
big blonde and beautiful you say my name
is Larry are you okay fuck it
where's all the reporters and
photographers and photographs I have a
million dollars
I got a billion dollars I got a million
dollars oh shit I'm gonna buy soda well
no we need it and we need a million and
$5 Oh million in five to buy the suit we
want to be sued I want to say like she
was a million in five before I did say I
be something to do you think that's
might be a referee cause it mentioned
that there's not a passport in there and
so I wonder if that's a reference to the
first leaders you're probably gonna need
a passport for the book there's a doc
and we won a cruise so we're probably
gonna need a suit sure folks and we're
probably gonna need a passport
I kind of do expect a passport alright
somebody says look in the hole on the
wall in the fence look at the fence okay
I should probably save probably I should
probably save what are we on Oh five
ah look at fence there's nothing
interesting about that fence unless you
find that Knothole interesting you bend
over and peer through the knothole in
the fence on the other side you see
people playing police quest how do you
wish you were one of them yeah that's my
please quite good I have it it's
installed I think is that the game's way
of telling you like yes we know you
should probably be playing something
else right now because this sucks
I think we love the Sarah adventure
games - hmm this one's not doing it for
me yeah yeah dude to do do to do to do
to do to do to to do do we want to go do
I want to go to the dress shop now well
that stuff has happened so we should
look around and see if there's like oh I
have a rank of dim bulb oh now no no
druggist yet we need to find that
clothes shop again where was that rich
tell Jack to look in the dumpster twice
in a row all right everybody hold on
gotta go past the scurvy dog the
dumpster over here
where was that damn could be quickly it
winds its irreverent white nothing close
late what are you get in there twice a
row and nothing happened you don't need
it okay wait it's not yours to drop one
dumpster fuck dumpsters my favorite band
is it yeah would you go see a band
called fuck dumpster I I have it's my
favorite band I just said so the
question for the chat is like assuming
you you have no idea what they sound
like you just saw in your local paper or
in your local internet provider yes that
the band fuck dumpster is coming to a
local venue sound unheard would you go
see fuck dumpster I might the
appropriate answer is absolutely
who wouldn't want to see a band called
fuck dumpster okay we cannot fuck who
dumpster also there's nothing in the
dumpster so whoever told us to check
twice was lying to us yes
you damn liar damn lying liar who lies I
have a million dollars now yeah no way I
know I want to find the dress shops or
the suit the city boot wears the suit
boom
well we probably need the haircut - yeah
but I need a million in five dollars
five million five just have 1 billion
exactly so I don't want to spend any of
it well we're going to find more
apparently at some point you're crazy
I think we're gonna we're gonna find
five dollars in the street somewhere in
the dumpster I need to stop walking in
the street I don't want a car to come by
and hit me where the fuck am i I want to

do do do do do do do do do do do do do
do do it's it's very weird that this
game like you just win a million dollars
and that's like the beginning of the
game yeah game over that was terrible
sorry box see that's bringing as I felt
pretty good about that I don't know
where the dress shop is which
okay I want to go to the scurvy dog
saloon by there's drunk sitting there
I'm gonna assume it's something I will
have to call the scurvy dog saloon they
might be down that's obviously not gonna
Brown her go down go left
I'm not through the bushes oh yeah try
that yes us to jam we're sticking this
out why cuz you know I think it's
important to give things a fair shake

house get out of here ladies
okay gotta find the suit shop don't find
them soon shop superjump gotta find the
suit jump suit jump up go to fenders

find out why aren't we playing Grim
Fandango because Jack wants to enjoy
that on the song hey look at how did the
Derby yeah I want to play Grim Fandango
my own no offence chat I want to want to
enjoy that game at my own pace
Jason working is an update on space cup
everyone just now three seconds closer
to being done that was my day nice the
overpriced but at least it's gaudy
that's literally three seconds to isn't
it yep is that all you did all day no I
did a couple other little effect shots
but that was the bulk of it that was
about six hours of work for three
seconds it looks great it turned out
well then it's time consuming
there's a sale sign on the rear wall
okay so they want me to go to the rear
wall hang swimsuits
oh look swimsuits Bryce wait a minute
these suits are marked down to Half
Price
only 100 thousand dollars with your
newfound wealth you could afford that
little blue bikini job hanging there
okay I think that sounds like a hint is
that what I'm supposed to do apparently
by bikini yeah
what presently my swimsuit instead of
beginning you might be confusing about
words that it doesn't know what they
mean
take the swimsuit to the counter what
why is your hand there there's something
going on with that hand yes hold on pick
use like a reasonably tight spandex job
and blue although it's cut is a little
tight perhaps that may work in your
advantage on the ship in fact this may
be the beginning of a whole new image
for you Larry yes that's what I was
supposed to pick up the suit I'm sorry
I'm sorry I'm only allowed to accept
purchases across the counter oh yeah
excuse me miss you say hesitantly do you
have change for a million Bella bueno
but of course this is that the treeview
little clearance item all your oh is
that is trivial it the clearance item
all you are going to purchase today
that's a hint oh yes ma'am I've only got
a million on me oh okay because it suits
a million five alright that will be how
one hundred and six thousand five
hundred including taxa your change is
eight hundred and ninety-three thousand
five hundred I do a great Italian it's
something that
that's a $100 $400 $500 down Sam don't
count me more I'd have that one before
my ship leaves very well Lissa she
concludes have a nice a day you're right
I am dangerously close to Professor
Frink territory who is himself
dangerously close to Jerry Lewis
territory your pocket you pocket your
now gigantic wad of $100 bills we did it
oh we are now a kumquat that is our rank
oh so I guess we can go buy a soda
should we go buy a soda we got a spare
might that ring on her finger there's
something weird right there's like it
her hand is there let's go talk to that
lady again
I agree see I think now we're getting to
the game I think that was just like a
long interlude a long opening sequence
that was very long
yes back do you say look at ring
maybe it's cuz she doesn't have her hand
out yet walk back by the suit since when
she put her hand up right by the
swimsuits when you were back there oh
yeah okay look now try looking right
oh maybe that's just a signifier that
she's married even though that's the
wrong hand yeah but what does why is
that important just question so we know
not to hate on her really I said well
here's the thing it's the wrong hand so
it doesn't matter if we just let you hit
on her and fill the fact that there's
even show it that it seems showing that
right is unusual she'd means there's
something with that ask about husband
hey my little Latino Bambino you say if
I told you I know I'm probably wealthy
I'm sure to endear yourself instantly to
her with that pseudo bilingualism
oh she defies how many shipping lines do
you own
ouch
thank you see ask about husband husband
okay
say asked about I'll wait so she puts
her maybe it's something to come back to
later I don't know it just seems odd
it's it's it's such a weird thing to do
that there has to be more to it by ring
ring ring we tried to ask about Wrangler
oh maybe maybe that's yeah we try to ask
for ring maybe that's just something we
come back to later maybe maybe someone
will say I need a ring before I can go
all the way yeah okay okay all right
okay all right listen we're a kumquat
now we will figure this out come quiet
yeah but why what does that mean
Sid you see the score 70 100 50 that
kind of just gives you an indicator of
how far you are in the game and so you
rank up and I think it's just as
humorous don't you get a date I don't
get it what the fuck indeed ghosts and
ghosts and goblins thank you for
subscribing we really appreciate it
did you play ghosts and goblins or
ghouls and ghosts also I like Mac smoke
goes to glory that one that's why I want
to stream at some point the winner okay
I want to buy a soda do buy that sort of
buy soda grab soda get soda take soda
grab drink take
use soda dispenser for that use soda
days Ben sir I can't spell use soda okay
cut that large might take a long time to
fill oh god there's a gigantic cup in
there yes yes I I did play maximum air
moves in its forever to fill it's
probably the most underrated brawler of
all time platformer slash brawler what
but merely an incredible simulation
you decide to put it in your pocket
along with everything else like oh my
god what it's an inventory joke cause
you frequently in these games you carry
about things you're carrying around so
much shit you wouldn't be able do it
that's a funny joke okay
here's a hundred dollar bill you offer
ok pod this is the clip too bad we don't
keep any change at this time of night
mud is broad daylight you're just have a
nice day okay yeah we got the soda oh
let's see here there is so we got the
soda we got the lottery ticket so we
still have the ticket huh we shall have
the ticket well we have okay cruise
ticket swimsuit whattodo grotesque gulp
grotesque gulp oh maybe we can give that
to the to the to the drunks really okay
alright okay watch it watch me say I
don't know should I or should I drink it
should I drink some soda save before you
do which the case you're right
I should do that
what are we out of 606 three suit Larry

starting to get into some of the game
the stuff of the game so I'm glad we
waited no cut so you're enjoying it more

any game is playing the game part of the
ball alien isolation oh hey I can get a

Jimmy Stewart

we've just stumbled we've just stumbled
into a spy story yay finally things are
happening we have accidentally sent the
code phrase nice
it's too bad like we actually didn't do
I know
see like normally in a game like this
you would find like a piece of paper
with a code phrase on it yeah that'd be
great that'd be fun this is a puzzle to
solve this is basically a cutscene that
I have to hit enter to me yeah
I'm almost done with this job we oh no
it's not back we can't be I'm fine with
that the microfiche containing the
secrets to the recent United States

arch-nemesis one day doctor no doctor no
no key you wanna bet it's a beautiful
woman so she's a Russian spy rich okay
muchos Gracias seniorita people seem to
like the idea of you not playing this
anymore yes it is do we do a different
adventure game it would do something
different entirely let's just get out of
this doctor no new key is what John John
B 820 is saying Oh their resume I was
gonna take a picture of our new key
collection cuz it's been we've added a
lot to it I need to do that at some
point do you want to show them the space
on the shelf next to it so they know how
many more we need no well they already
know how many more we need just a couple
more I think three three more three we
discussed this last time and we got one
in the meantime work yeah more in read
we have it okay so we're done with this
game so the to answer your question of
water here whether we play this or
another adventure game or something else
somewhere close to four total hours I'm
down with that
I don't know I don't know you know what
I do want to take a moment to talk about
yeah remember the other day before we'd
like play a new game or whatever which
might involve me concentrating remember
the other week we were talking about me
generally not being disappointed with
the Fantastic Four trailer just like oh
it was fine and I have no hard feelings
that are strong feelings either way all
right sure I saw a trailer today that
reminded me what disappointment is it's
the daredevil TV trailer I haven't seen
that Anderson it's really disappointing
yeah it just looks uninteresting and it
doesn't show you anything good the suit
looks dumb what's kind of dumb no I was
disappointed by the trailer which of
course doesn't mean anything really and
then I thought to myself this is what it
feels like disappointed by something I'm
reminded this is what it feels like to
be disappointed everyday something every
day does it the Jurassic world trailer
yeah every day there's something to
remind you that you're just going to be
disappointed yeah except for the Mad Max
trailers whoa those are the best the
fond of Mad Max and those trailers look
fun it's still just gonna be a dumb
action movie with a guy who's called Mad
Max that's okay it's not like I don't
like when I think of Mad Max it's not
like oh that rule belongs to Mel Gibson
like I don't have strong feelings about
him where is the actor just stop the
movie it's the actions gonna be larger
and more over-the-top
that's okay I the original movies the
actions don't mean two on the top yeah I
like the setting of mainly the the
second one that's the only one that's
really loved but nice style and I love
that don't look of that universe Oh
Charlize Theron futuristic tech know if
you look at it it's made of like
wrenches and shit like it's made of like
junk which i think is neat
I'm excited does it actually move on its
own I don't know okay we could loses on
the train
I just know that there's like a wrench
on there and I think that's cool be down
with the cool this Ridge alright man
Max's style over substance it's awesome
post-apocalyptic future cars Phillip and
over on dirt roads future cars flip it
over and that's just a bunch of cool
shit I might hang with that for Mad Max
I hope they properly conveyed that I
think they will I mean it's the same guy
than me the other one oh yeah he's just
he was directing it yeah oh yeah that's
the same guy that created Mad Max okay
first three movies so get on the trolley
rich he also directed happy feet so
maybe a dancing penguin will show up
somewhere I'm sorry directed happy for
you the guy who made Mad Max movies did
happy feet you see and happy feet I
haven't seen any awful it's worse than
awful oh really
yeah Wow unbearable okay on what's the
matter I didn't variable an hour into
the movie a new movie starts oh it was
really late huh are you looking at what
games you yeah are we screaming you
looking at your games right now I think
I turned it off okay yeah you did great
um Rich's looking at what games he has
Lego Marvel Super Heroes that would be a
stark contrast magic magic huh mercenary
Kings Metal Gear Rising revengeance
revengeance that's not a that's not a
universe but it's a good crazy action
game oh okay yeah that's just not a word
revengeance um
quake for that beef I mean you know sure
rogue legacy if you want to shank shank
doesn't require many brain cells sure
nothing matters and everything's cool
anything is possible I don't know what
I'm in the mood for are you and the boy
you only put for anything
am I in the mood for anything oh yeah
if I'm gonna play something it's gonna
be something I've never played before
because I'm what are you doing what do I
got that you like here oh I like being
surprised see why we just to pick a game
for you that's wrong listed in there
somewhere

out what's that that's that first person
you shooter with Tron you do three oh
you just throw your disc though is that
like and there are blocks
let's go game yeah yeah that doesn't
sound like what I would want in a Tron
game though what do you want from him
you want a light cycle oh good you know
what we could play the light cycle
portion there's a separate there's a
separate light cycle oh really
thing for Tron yeah we'll play light

I don't see a way to get the joystick
buttons you could figure to the light
cycle controls I don't have time to
figure it out so oh that's why I'm
saying game alright yeah I was gonna say
should have showed up but now yeah
basically rich is ruining everything
okay
thankee alright we're just ruining so I
mean I'm gonna you're gonna steer that's
all I'm doing here erasing anybody
that's one right now
the camera but higher or lower Oh God
you know the next monkey review that the
daredevil trailer looks fine like it's
an overall trailer but I have come to
expect a certain amount of camel feet
thank you for subscribing I've come to
expect a certain amount of awesome to
come out of Marvel Studios and I know
this is a series a Netflix original
series so the budgets gonna be a little
cut but I wanted uh some a little bit
more Mandrake was here thank you for
subscribing Wow we very much appreciate
it
this is gonna be a plane is this on
that's fine that's fine
I want to live in the Tron world okay
somebody turns out the computer and
you're basically dead oh my god I can't
don't easy this for hard drive to break
you live in the film the Troma world was
on its own server we learned that from
Tron Legacy oh well sorry Mandrake was
here if you subscribed an hour ago I
just got the notification he was in the
Jeff Bridges was stuck in the Tron world
for like 30 years or not over 20 years
oh I think she pulled forward to speed
up and back to for the primary on the
other fuck this is complicated not
complicated but in the the way the
camera turns with you makes us tricky
it's not just like an overhead shot like
the old like the game of the movie sure
might be a setting for that Oh dick
neutral eye I actually kind of like the
the costume they have their devil and
now it's it's like the black version of
his daredevil costume with like the
cloth mask I really like the black
costume but like we didn't even see it
during the trailer we don't know you
know I don't I actually dislike
Daredevils red costume I think that
looks super lame I like his ninja pasty
guy so I do
to be fair Jack's blind he has no idea
what his costume looks like 100% 100%
it won't be is awesomeness the Ben
Affleck movie so I even bother trying
rights will there be a playground fight
with electro that's my number one
question got ya know I
I hope they stick with that black outfit
longer I like it because that's his like
ninja outfit and I think that's badass
outfit well
nice day you got more moves like jagger
it's true cuz he is slow moving
that is that a link is a link yeah kind
of like I'm not good at this maybe I
shouldn't live in the Tron world oh fuck
Oh incidentally if you're really close
to another wall you speed up oh yeah
rich yes so this is this is tell of us
apparently Billy Bob Thornton has made a
statement earlier today so one who the
fuck cares that statement just a general
statement well someone that said do you
agree with the statement Billy Bob
Thornton and made earlier today that
video games have negatively influenced
the ways that Studios shoot their movies
and the choices for which productions go
into greenlight I would like to hear
more elaboration on the statement I
don't know I can't please does he think
video games have influenced movies I
think Billy Bob Thornton's a dickhead I
think he's a great actor but I do think
he's kind of a dick I'm willing to hear
what he has to say though about video
game yeah I would need some more
elaboration I can't imagine that a video
game would influence any production of a
movie yeah you have that skill but
technically you're not using a training
butters does any of the bubbles and
activate that no no all right
Sheils acquired yes okay it's the mouse
button so now I can I fly through this
now yes ma'am
fuck you Oh another works ones Jake oh
all right Oh Oh you have to do that yeah
yeah that's right if anything he got it
backwards like a movie release schedule
dictates when a video game will come out
that is a movie tie-in like I can't
imagine that like I can't imagine a
shield
you hit him not the wall you depressed
oh oh I okay I can't hit him directly
that's like I'll get the hang of this
someday probably not today Oh exact same
thing happened last time
huge huge a 81 just linked it to old a
new daredevil costumes I like that black
costume I think that's badass costume
and apparently daredevil in the black
costume was on an episode of Incredible
Hulk the Lou Ferrigno TV show okay
could be tear both eyes are one thank
you for subscribing
we very much appreciate it
haha Jack what do you think about the
statement that Angelina Jolie is a
pretty lady um I have no strong feelings
about the physical appearance of
Angelina Jolie what you guys think about
Angelina Jolie yeah the lips look
freakish I had never thought her lips
were attractive I have never found her
attractive but I don't find her
unattractive yeah I would like if I were
to make a list of like like if I were to
make like a really classy list and title
it something like the top ten girls I
want a bang from Hollywood like you know
something like a really awesome list
like that I would not put her in Milan I
thought she was super hot and hackers
shut up way back in the day shut up
really yeah
in hackers I haven't seen that movie
since high school but I remember like
that was before she was anybody and I
was like this is a sexy lady you think I
haven't seen it since son he's called
that guy's stuck
who is the most attractive woman that is
ever better looking ooh oh my it's very
subjective of course yes forsenrp yeah
Jennifer Connelly
I've always thought she's here like do
you like Jennifer Connelly I love dark
hair
they have Jennifer Connelly all right
sure you know I've been I sake over yeah
that's fine one I really like that for
for anyone for anyone who's a Doctor Who
fan I really really like that Karen
Gillan oh yeah she's super cute we only
seen her in oculus I think let's see oh
no she's in guardians of the galaxy -
well yeah but in guardians she's you
know cover colored blue and has a shaved
head but yeah but as far as like what
she actually looks like I've only seen
oculus yeah yeah she's super cute I
really like how cute she is
I wouldn't I don't know if I'd call her
super hot though I have to find it a lot
of people will really like that Conway
rich tired and sad thank you for
subscribing
we very much appreciate it oh the green
zones make you go really fast
the red ones slow you down yeah like I
didn't want to say Scarlett Johansson
just cuz that's so obvious but I mean
she's very she's a very but like she's
the attractive lady that everyone talks
about now so I was looking for outside
the box but obviously Scarlett Johansson
like jennifer connelly now or Jennifer
kind of label say no I haven't seen her
recently but certainly certainly no
Rockets here yes all right
I don't know if her face is falling all
up in recent years she's gone super
scrawny like scary skinny yeah if her
face is falling off as far as I know her
face is not oh no she's just gotten
really like scary skinny okay Hollywood
actresses and their their plastic
surgery doesn't always work out very
well
sure so her face Jo someone is wondering
if oculus is worth a watch they keep
saying uh you know what I really liked
oculus I think it got kind of mixed
reviews it's not a perfect movie but I
thought it was it's really like simple
and straightforward and it does a lot of
what we attempted to do with our movies
in recovery goddammit um which is
towards the end of our movie we have it
where it's just constantly cutting back
and forth between the past and the
present does that like really
effectively Karen Gilliam Gilligan
what's-her-name going she's really good
um I think it's worth while it's on
Netflix now so it's free if you have
Netflix yeah I think it's worth their
time that's oh that yeah then the
question is just is it worth your time I
think so okay they go strong it's not a
perfect movie but I thought it was
pretty interesting just in its
simplicity mm-hmm
I'm sorry Emery I don't know who those
ladies are guys they're asking what do
you think of Sasha Grey or Lisa and oh
shit I do grana was a porn star now
she's trying to do with Egypt stuff
because of the Steven Soderbergh film
the girlfriends experience she was in
the ok stage yeah maybe if she was a
successful porn star I can only assume
she's attractive so I'll say go for it
she wasn't something else recently
mm-hmm I know she was in the the
Soderbergh movie yeah and at least one
other thing yes Karen Gillan is the blue
cybernetic chick in guardians of the
galaxy she was also the doctors
companion for a couple seasons for the
Matt Smith seasons of Doctor Who she was
also in a BBC produced movie about a
model and photographer that was pretty
bad and apparently innocuous she was on
a comedy thing reasoning as well oh she
had a sitcom that lasted like like a
three god damn it I'm trying to talk
about cute ladies while they play Tron
know she had like us like a network
sitcom and the gun can right away oh
that's rain that apparently wasn't that
bad
I don't know it but guy can't knowing
she also is I'm like two episodes of
that Paul Scheer like NST oh yeah oh
guys here's the billy-bob quote already
we're living in a time when we're making
in my humble opinion the worst movies in
history they're geared towards the
video-game-playing generation and these
video games which I'm on my son about
constantly these games are people
killing for fun and I think
traditionally in movies there's always
been some kind of lesson in violent
movies
what was the lesson in die hard
yeah don't die so soft
yeah no it sounds more like it sounds
more like he's just kind of out of touch
I mean I would agree that a lot of
modern action movies suck but it sounds
like Billy Bob Thornton might be a
cranky old man he sounds a little home
town markup thank you for subscribing
for the past six months now thank you
well you watch less ah speaking of
actually good action movies John wick
with Keanu Reeves I've heard great
things it's really fucking good as far
as an action movie and it's like not a
great movie but like the action it is
really well done cuz I ate like the the
close-up shaky-cam quit cutting and this
is like nice wide shots you see the
fight choreography the house of creative
fight scenes yeah really really solid
action movie that's good you actually
care about him as a character that's
great yeah I like that yeah it's it's
pretty good okay I hear I hear they're
they're already talking sequel oh why
didn't I don't even know if it was a hit
it was I guess I'm talking see going on
there's no reason to make a sequel the
stories told yeah what he's fighting for
in that movie is that like that's the
movie like I don't want to see another
movie with him beating people up this is
motivation in it is like perfect that's
great I've been you know I keep seeing
that come up on unstuff and is like I
should I should watch that I think I
would say
worth watching you heard it here
marvelous and John wick
come on worth watching oh they're saying
even I would understand the motivation
of John wick oh do they repeat it like
every ten minutes cuz you know I need
that they there's one scene where he
gets really upset and he kind of spells
it out a little more than the movie
needed to okay keep coming get on the
surface
he's fighting these guys because they
killed his dog oh but that's just on the
surface oh well the dog represents which
is pretty apparent no then they have a
scene where he has to directly explain
gotten what the dog represents this is
just in case anyone is really dumb
gotcha no I was gonna turn you then turn
again yeah I'm not good at this yes
we've all seen every 90s commercial ever
and enjoyed it
oh god yeah it's great yeah it was funny
I I put a link to it in the beginning of
the chat
oh yeah that's where we started yeah
fragment performance Jake oh but uh yeah
every nineties come here summer funny
stuff different area sure those uh
whatever those rocket jump guy is a good
stuff I no idea there that's that
Freddie way I don't know that is he did
it's a pretty famous youtuber Freddie
Boop okay he does video game things you
might not know you you might not know
pretty Wang you're right not Freddie
wooo Freddie wooo is the oh my god I
apologize to Freddie Wong who's not
listening to this
because on his YouTube channel his
YouTube channel just used to be Freddie
W and so I apologize profusely so no one
in particular
so it's too quick beyond it's really
quick yeah beyond infinite I have an
answer for your question again infinite
asks honest question what will happen if
boyhood wins best got best Oscar yeah
yeah the answer is absolutely fucking
nothing the world will keep turning
people will forget about it next year
what you know name the movies that have
won Best Picture last for the last ten
years I bet you can only name a couple
of them shit James shit was not shit was
that one shit did you love them I'll
worship yeah but was the most impressive
building us a bar the 21st century yes
of course like important movie ever made
like like who who's still talking about
the artists but that's I've mentioned
that no shit I'm stuck I mentioned that
honor let's tap on the back ever so oh
yeah like that was the huge movie that
year nobody talks about it anymore
yep guess what people two years from now
no one will remember what boyhood is
this is a very true thing
one year Julia Roberts won Best Actress
over Ellen Burstyn Ellen Burson's
performance in requiem for a dream which
is an amazing performance Julia Roberts
won for Erin Brockovich who cares
yeah the Oscars oh there you go someone
is saying remember crash meaning oh yeah
crash yeah that's another one that was
like biggest speaking French I think we
crashed I crashed in the game and then
we crashed did everything crash
everything crashed

think we're still open maybe not they
did so bad try again um if someone else
wants to play something they can I'm
having fun but I know I'm terrible if
you're fun I don't I don't give a shit
okay well I think we're back on now
let's go back to the newbie zone okay
that sounds like a great idea you guys
so we were talking about crash and the
computer crashed

killer app crashed it's kind of kind of
spooky we can hear your great
we're back here again everybody

Pokemon thing apparently now I don't

challenge is so explain what that is and
I'll tell you if I would ever consider
doing that for a prereq stream you

Nuzlocke challenge
oh my guises they're so fast yeah you
Orion Lexus for this shit
yeah a Pokemon that faint is considered
dead and must be released that's nice
only catch the first please there's no
second chances
oh yeah that's an interesting thing shit
that's an interesting challenges I've
you won't understand because but the
Nuzlocke Jam seems interesting the other
challenge that I've wanted to do or that
I have done personally in Pokemon is you
only get to catch six Pokemon so you
know of course there's hundreds of
Pokemon in every game but in order to
make the game harder for me I've given
myself a limit where I can only catch
six and no more and so there's no
swapping them out for Pokemon later
there's no like building them up and
just to fight one you can hold me catch
six the entire game toughest fuck yes we
will do a Pokemon stream of rich we'll
play pokemon it will be a great time
damn it I have not agreed to this it's
gonna happen and if he's not gonna do it
I'm gonna play pokemon while rich and
Jay talk about shit it's gonna be
awesome
that sounds great fucking love Pokemon I
have not played any of the new
generation of Pokemon which is upsetting
to me mostly
for yourself honestly you need to play
others Pokemon poké ball the Pope I need
to get a 3ds with a card that's why I
don't want to run away I want to kill
these guys why didn't your strategy of
hitting them head on
well that's not my strategy that's just
what happens what's happening miss mr.
glitchet doesn't make you a bad person
if you've never played a Pokemon game
there it certainly does not it just
means he hasn't played it hasn't played
it I would I'd recommend it just go
straight for its it's like a light to
our PG it's fun you see a cute little
monster thing like a good strategy
get to know what I heard there's a
button to see it up and slow down Itamar
source right end zone phenomena what

problem oh my god excuse me I burped and
you might have heard that a lot of
subscriptions you're gonna be open this
is gonna take forever this guy I know
you're gonna drive around beyond
infinite says all these Pokemon games
are ruining movies get off my lawn I
agree I think I think she's saying like
dumbed down Hollywood movies and
thinking this video games movies are
really dumb I don't know that I would
blame video games cuz it started with
CGI in the 90s when video games were
hurry oh yeah
video game generation expects non-stop
explosions and then he said somebody's
seen his son play video game yeah so
it's probably just walked into his room
his like this is dumb Hollywood movies
are done I guess there's a correlation
right
yeah good thing that Billy Bob Thornton
is a good actor because otherwise he
would bug me more he's just a dickhead
he's kind of a dick all I can think of
is like a while back he was on huh he
was unlike like a Canadian Reno I saw
that yeah yeah with his band and someone
was like so you you act you're in a band
like how does how did he deal with doing
both of them and he just was a dick to
the guy yeah it was like he didn't want
to talk about movies or something right
isn't that what he had two previous ed
you should a sweet move you did you did
it I did it how do you think to do that
I saw him coming towards me so I reacted
I don't know if Jay can talk to you guys
more about possession he'd be delved
into it pretty deeply but Jay if you
would like to talk more about possession
possession is the best movie it's the
best movie ever and everybody should
watch it it's hard to find but it's it's
really really great I don't know what me
to say that I haven't already talked
about right he did a whole thing on it
convinced me I should watch it I'm
excited to see it everyone shows oh
that's right mr. glitched Billy Bob
Thornton was like would you ask Tom
Petty about his acting career no cuz
he's not an actor
using the postman yep actor Billy Bob
Thornton is a dancer an actor and he was
an actor first yeah
listen this might be common knowledge
but I just saw something about community
I thought was great
I've never I've never actually seen an
episode of community oh yeah I was
watching a clip on YouTube and
apparently the third time that they
mentioned beetlejuice oh yeah show yeah
in the background through a window
somebody dressed well that's fun yeah
yeah the name Beale Jesus said three
different times than when they say it
the third time it's Justin far in the
background it's not same episode either
is it is it different episodes or is it
the same as its I wanna say it's all in
the same episode
okay been a while I've seen other things
on the internet where it's like in the
beginning of a season you see like a
couple in the background get together
and then later on in the season you see
that same couple like getting married in
the background and then later on in the
season you see like that couple giving
birth in the Bears yeah there's lots of
background gags it's a smart show
sometimes maybe I'll watch one of these
days damn it he's going faster they're
saying that Alison Brie is real pretty
like yes yes I agree wholeheartedly Jay
got excited I like that Elsa know she is
very attractive and she's also super
funny know which makes her more attract
oh that was good yeah jonbi 820 damn it
if you're looking for some cool music
videos to watch one you should watch
turn down for what oh god yeah because
that's an amazing music video should
also look into we are water music video
directed by Eric Wareheim I forget what
the what the name of the band is but I
know the song is called we are water and
it's a fucking amazing music video
there's a there's a million a million
jillion great music videos out there
right
oh that's right she is in madmen as well
she's the wife in Mad Men Jay doesn't
watch madmen no no breeze on that - yeah
I do I just was putting it together I
was just putting it together do you want
your chair back oh I just need to sit
somewhere but there's no way for me to
get around no I was reminded speaking of
ladies yeah I was we watched a movie for
best of the worst recently but the next
best of the worst that had pj souls in
it there's a writing of how big of a
crush I had on PJ Souls in high school
cuz she was in the movie rock and roll
high school okay and she's like just so
energetic and perky in that movie I had
the biggest crush on her that in
Halloween she's one of the friends she's
one of the girls there's three of them
she's one of them okay she's the one
that dogs her boyfriends is I goes on to
get the beer and then comes back up into
Michael Myers with a sheet over him and
then he strangles her with the phone
line okay that's P Jesus okay be like
what PJ Zeus Peters is great if you
haven't seen rock and roll high school
you will fall in love with PJ soles
because of that movie and it's a fun
movie anyway have you ever seen it what
rock n roll high school no The Ramones
it's a fun movie even regardless of that
sure sure
no I know it's one of those I don't know
I don't like movies or music or books or
video games you know what I understand
fuck you jack I know I'm sorry I just
okay and I don't find ya how do we
decide what movies were gonna watch on
best of the worst we figure it out yeah
we look at like what have we done lately
um what happened we done lately what
movies do we have that fit the genre
that we haven't done lately yeah
recently we received a ton of a certain
genre of movie and you're like well we
got a bunch of these and they all look
great
so let's watch those for the next best
of worst and that's how it was done yeah
and we do have a big sheet of ideas for
episodes we haven't used any of them yet
but we haven't we we actually spent a
decent amount of time like writing down
and coming up with a list of ideas that
we have since never used yeah but we can
use them if we don't have any other
ideas for like well we got that list
just look at the list oh yeah we'll do
try to find a theme yeah
that's right I only enjoyed a good wood
carving craftsmanship what Christmas
that's the only thing I enjoy wood
carving and the occasional ukulele solo
I was that true they made an unofficial
sequel to robot jacket the family global
robot students really know they made
there was a sequel called Robot Wars
okay but that was still stop-motion
robots what who said that unless they're
just thinking of another movie with
robots in it but the the sort of sequel
made by Charles ban in the same
production company was Robot Wars that's
super boring yeah but it knows that it's
not much from the robots digital artery
defend yourself tell me what move
yourself J says you're full of shit I'm
calling you out and if you don't defend
yourself he's gonna punch you in the
face oh yeah I said it Oh it's called
robo-warrior that has nothing to do with
robot jocks unofficial sequel so does
that just mean like it's also about it's
just another movie with giant robots
it's a Pacific Rim is an unofficial
sequel to a robot Johnson right they
stopped fighting each other to fight the
big monsters yes that's actually how the
yeah other people have also suggested a
worst of the best oh yeah well we were
talking about the other day there was a
couple movies surahs like these are -
they're B movies but they're probably
too good
yeah where it wouldn't be like funny or
painful to watch yeah so we might do
that oh wait I think we have two movies
in mind and we could easily find a third
comes from our suffering
yeah episode where we watch a good movie
gonna be a different thing and when we
accidentally watch a good movie that's
its own thing - yeah I never would like
Extro and thunderpants yeah extras three
I want to re-watch that - I haven't seen
it since then
SiC moves
she got moves like uh sure not like
jagger cuz he's an old man
uh sure good man I'm Adam Sandler best
of the worst no no we don't eat
ourselves that much oh I did I did want
to do like a UH like a 2014 budget flop
best of the worst hmm oh yeah we talked
about that where we watch you like
actual big Hollywood movies that just
did really poorly and yeah suffice but
again part of the charm is older movies
yeah more so I just want to see I
Frankenstein will do something we have
to do something with i Frankenstein
because I'm still curious to see it too
right don't you just want to know what's
going on
former SNL members best of the worst oh
that might be too bad yeah remember
something we've talked about a lot is
nothing is worse than failed comedy yes
nothing
by the way I can't get it to accept uh
one of the buttons on this controller he
is in it to win and he lost it no but he
was in it in order to use the power-ups
I need to click on the mouse button may
the best camera travel route that how
many copies of i Frankenstein do we need
I guess just ones one I know it's on
Netflix right now - it's really
something I can't my only problem is
usually you know like I only watch stuff
oh yeah I can't put her through that
yeah that's understandable
valera program fuck you we've kind of
done that yeah you can't do the watching
three movies at the same time thing
again yeah it was reserved for the right
free movies yes there would be no
purpose in doing it again not funny the
second time yeah there were a lot of
comments oh he put that video up though
they were like do these movies next it's
like now it's a one-off yeah there's no
reason to do it again it would be it
would be interesting educational you
know like how you guys are finding the
similarities and story structure so they
would it would be an interesting
educational piece fuck
also we don't want to die
thank you do that with the right that
made rich rethinking
yes resin did you ever see the matrix
equals yeah okay
I remember seen the second one in the
theater we went to a midnight showing of
it like first showing and everybody was
jazz and the movie starts you know the
opening logo comes up and everyone
breaks out an applause yeah yeah every
was so excited and then a Titan of like
that for the first opening action scene
there was some applause and there's a
bunch of boring dialogue and everyone
was quiet and then there's the fight
with all the Smiths in the the where
they yeah yeah yeah with all the Smiths
amends and there's like a tiny
smattering of applause and then it was
just dead silence for the rest of the
movie that was no that was too but yeah
and then it was like after that fight
everyone's like I guess I don't mind the
Matrix sequels that much they they are
their own thing I don't think I hate him
as much as a lot of other people but
that's also because I wasn't super into
the matrix to begin with right
I think it's good but I wasn't like you
know it wasn't like Star Wars to me here
the Lord of the Rings or something right
but they're still not very good no
there's tons and tons of stilted boring
dialogue yeah I liked what they were
trying to do story wise I thought it was
interesting you know storylines
but it was just so unnecessary
the matrix the matrix was its own
insular thing yeah yeah I really I
really did like the the Animatrix those
little short stories I never saw that
you know because there was just like
little pieces of the world yeah well
once you establish like at the end of
the first movie neo is Superman now yeah
like once you establish that guy
remember the Agent Smith fight at the
end he just flies away you're like why
was he fighting him to begin with he
could have float away in any moment
right just think this is all so
pointless now there's no there's no
weight to it ya know and then it's like
he can stop bullets midair right like
that's that's one of the first scenes
right he stops all the hundreds of
bullets and so then they kung fu fight
it's like why don't you stop their fists
or the sword they're swinging at you why
can you only stop bullets and nothing
else or just fly away or because you can
do this he's just fucking with them why
he's having fun
fucking he's having fun how can you tell
these I mean funny things it makes sense
it's it's it's it's a Sherlock Holmes
skill which you eliminate all other
possibilities when you're left with it
has to be the truth okay it's fucking
with them I agree mr. glitch the
Animatrix is the sequel the series
really you watch the first movie and
then watch the Animatrix and it just
gives you little chunks of the world
it's great Animatrix is really amazing
stories I've never seen I recommend that
high
the sequels are just so unnecessary
Richard much better at this than I am
yes Batman has Animatrix tight shorts no
John kilo link link me that would be
great
Nico : I am enjoying a lovely snack of
water
as you should know I usually don't snack
what I'm here because I have to drive
home and I'm a responsible adult Wow
it's true
I'm also a terrible terrible lightweight
if there's anything you need to know
about me is I can no longer hold my
boobs so if I have one I'm done for them
tonight
I know I have not seen black mirror yet
I'm so you gotta watch it I know no good
I'm talking weeks into it we're gonna
yeah
next next chance we can watch it there
you go can't wait to see that pig fucker
it's the first episode you're like
alright I guess this is where we're
going
thank you thank you already seen you li
almost
what are you saying
text it father twice over and I crossed
another pig fucker so what you're just
describing what happens on the show this
what I'm saying on the show they want to
make a guy fuck a pig right that's just
the premise when you prefer we say make
love I'm pretty sure that's not the case
have relations with the pig oh he's
gonna naughty that oh shit
no I'm not I'm not terribly excited for
the new season of Game of Thrones I I
mostly watch it because it's what my
wife likes to watch cuz she read the
books and as I've mentioned before if it
wasn't a long time I have to have to
have her tell me like oh this guy is
this and he's doing this how many books
are there supposed to be the six is
supposed to be supposedly not coming out
this year right what is the TV show do
when they catch up even if they manage
to dodge the bullet and catch up with
the sixth book in seventy you've gotta
take years of the six one two years oh
yeah he doesn't go for the show HBO will
catch up sooner or later
what do they do they just cancel the
show do they make up their own ending
take a weight that's make it way yeah if
I tell they don't have what if the
actors are doing other things
well actors are gonna weigh around or
they'll do what didn't when they were
filming the Potter the Harry Potter
movies the last book wasn't done yet and
I think like JK Rowling just like so
that girl is that what they did yeah
okay I don't know why I whispered this
is secret JK Rowling informed the
writers of her plans how they could get
an early start on drafts I believe
necro dance the night away what is this

[Part IV]
what I click that a link I shouldn't
click on links link yes is it related to
Pig fucking I have no idea
I'll tell her guys telegin I'm watching
that thing you're like I can only see
related to pig fucking because it's
called squeal fuckers
making a double feature at the
documentary about the guy who fucked a
horse what was that called again zoo
just Gazoo yeah it's called zoo I still
haven't seen mode
hey Jay yes have you seen the youtuber
every frame of painting
no I haven't but it's been brought to my
attention a lot lately so I guess I
should check it out I don't know if it's
just a guy that reviews movies that
probably won't be interested if it's
something different than that like
essays or something maybe every frame of
painting makes it sound like I don't
know maybe Oh does he paint picture
frames are you saying that J's frames
are ugly they are they're all black you
see that if you see the frames in the
best of the worst screams normal black
friends they're appropriate though for
the movies that they're framed well you
don't need anything more complicated
than a plain black frame for Hollywood
cop maybe you're just not trying hard
I'm not because I don't care oh and
someone else mentioned film critic Hulk
I've been linked to his articles I've
skimmed um
he seems intelligent I cannot get past
the all-caps thing I cannot read all
caps it hurts my brain because it's
short ya know he writes essays I guess
they're intelligent they're well liked
written there but I that's what I hear
anyway I can't read them yeah I guess
that's the gimmick is that it's Hulk but
he's being intelligent about movies but
he still refers to himself in the third
person and he types on caps and I I
can't get past that okay personally so I
don't understand why he needs a gimmick
but yeah whatever that's his thing is
that too long for you guys on the TV
how would I oh I say someone mentioned
Plinkett when I talked about a review
that's in a gimmick form but the Plinkett
reviews are comedic and I didn't from
what I skimmed of The Hulk stuff it's not
there's nothing like it's just written
like a normal person would write
something yeah like there's no jokes or
there's nothing related to and being
Hulk right from what I've seen I mean
maybe I'm wrong but well and while we
like the Plinkett character I could see
I could easily see someone not liking
the voice oh sure that happens all the
time yeah so maybe it's like that's the
case with me with the Hulk one but I
just don't see what the when the rest of
the writing is just completely normal
there's no jokes there's nothing related
to being Hulk I don't understand just
writing in all caps and saying you're
Hulk so it's possible I'm missing
something I haven't read enough to
really say if you just if you don't like
the character that he's writing in then
yeah that's part of it let's say and it
just hurts my eyes reading the all-caps
I just don't like doing it I think
that's fair enough why you gotta hate
Jake yeah I'm not my hater who was the
guy who made the crowdfunding for his
YouTube channel but never delivered on
his promise I'm sure a ton but you if
you're talking about Harry Knowles yeah
you might be specifically talking about
Harry Knowles he's made many jokes about
Harry domes cool news who apparently had
a large tax bill and then raised a bunch
of money for a YouTube show equal to
that large know the tax thing is
unrelated it's unrelated the fact that
right after reaching their Kickstarter
goal and getting the money the fact that
he bought a new car right after that I'm
sure that's unrelated to the fact that
he has not made that new thing
yeah it's been like two years he just
hasn't done it
teller god no I will not watch squeal
have you ever read any of Harry Knowles
writing no it's it's horrible it's like
a 12 year old yeah
yeah he's terrible writer I think he got
popular because there was no one else at
the time when that sight was coming up
there was no one I was doing that cool
inacol news yeah yeah no I I think I've
been to that website a couple times
didn't much care for yeah well it's
completely useless in this day and age
there's so many other places to get
information but it started that was the
place to go I remember even back in the
day not liking the site yeah I didn't

man that says Jack I saw a video of you
with hair what the hell happened did
those guys stress you out to the point
where your hair fell out
absolutely absolutely
Oh 100% Jay Mike and rich yeah in
actuality I started losing my hair in
high school it started thinning right
out of high school like I was I didn't
lose it yeah but if anyone has seen the
the behind-the-scenes featurettes
feeding frenzy oh yeah you got long hair
in that that was and I had my big beard
at that point yeah that was my longest
hair and beard I looked great
yeah yet hair in the early best of the
worst yeah yeah and the first best the
worst I still had the crowd wow I don't
even remember that was before I was
shaving and I look weird huh I look back
on that man
I saw somebody asked it's gone now but I
think they've tried a few times ask
about David Lynch's dune have you ever
seen it yeah is that a petition of dune
no I've never seen it either I've seen
parts of it I've tried watching it
because I love David Lynch but I could
never get through the first like 15 20
minutes like I'm done I'm not getting
anything out of this I've never seen the
whole thing despite my love for David
Lynch not familiar with the source
material I never read the book I guess
the movies a mess anyway so it's never
felt the need to I tried watching it
just to see everything that he had done
but there's nothing in it for me so I
gave up
I tried washing when I was a kid but I
was a kid so I might be young well I
guess it's a mess anyway as far as an
adaptation goes yeah yeah yeah you know
what dude was before our time I think uh
I really eighties I was young 80s - I
remember I remember one of us up so it
was after yeah David Lynch had done
Eraserhead and then he got hooked up
with Mel Brooks and did Elephant Man and
it's like all right now you're in the
mainstream make a big movie so he made
doing it was like a horrible disaster I
was like fuck that I'm making blue
velvet I'm gonna be weird it perverted
oh that man is great dude came out in 82
I just born so I think it's later than
82 but early 80s anyway I'm good
it was then that was definitely before
my time I was too young for you sure so
then ya know I tried the first time I
tried watching it was in high school
because I was just starting to get in
David Lynch but I was like now I'm done
maybe I'll try watching it again it's
been like a decade you go give it one
more chance you never know
sure whatever if you haven't seen it
Chad
you should check out David Lynch talking
about being asked to direct return to
Jenna oh god it's so great it's on
YouTube and it's kind of amazing David
Lynch makes George Lucas sound like the
biggest fucking weirdo the David Lynch
State syringe and you seen this dick no
oh you've never seen it it's so good I
mean I just I think David Lynch is just
a fun storyteller in general when he's
just sitting there and talking about
things but yeah him talking about
meeting with George Lucas to direct
return of the jedis talking about George
Lucas and someone was someone was making
some generalizations about George
Lucas's career as relating to his wife
leaving him oh sure yeah and the only
thing you know like some of the things I
think out in the divorce was is the
properties like she didn't take that and
so he just kind of yeah there's
something weird going on there
psychologically and you know we will
ever know the full extent of it she was
such a major player in the re-edit of
the first Star Wars and she oh yeah
around for the pitching of Indiana Jones
and so I was like she was there for thx
she was there for American Graffiti so
maybe the talent that's been set before
it who are we then know for sure but
it's it's been son it was his wife
someone to bounce off oh sure
Barclay DC thank you for subscribing we
very much appreciated if you divorce us
will be less without you we do see is
that a soccer thing it sounds like a
soccer dubious I wasn't shot
right what are your feelings on Dethklok
ah
like I like Metalocalypse yeah
is that a min alaq ellipse reference no
Beca I've never seen it that's good they
saw my I to us and mermaid er was on
their game mermaid or mermaid murder
it's part of the that's one of the
Metalocalypse socks it's it's own thing
it's different than home movies it's
it's it's own thing Metalocalypse is is
it is unique I just want them to hurry
up and finish it I was this so going Shh
Mabel Mabel that's a great question rich
I will ask this to you continue I wonder
if you could own one arcade cabinet rich
this background which fine I would be it
would be a tough decision for me I what
I would really want is the sixth player
x-men arcade cabinet fucking love that
game x-men use it once every 12 years
when you get to six people together grew
care yeah really I can't have the four
person x-men arcade
speaking of the four person x-men arcade
Cameron there is one at classic slice
pizza you can have pizza and play the
x-men arcade game
but yeah I probably want the x-men
arcade game cabinet this one I played a
lot gonna oh the Simpsons arcade game
that was awesome really no but I play
them a lot it's you know like just like
the x-men game they're just all there
all those brawlers are seeing on
standard brawlers fuck him up time but
yeah just if I can have one arcade game
it would not be one of those old
brawlers no really I don't need it x-men
is that classic slice if you go to organ
Piper the organ pipe er has the Simpsons
arcade cabinet
telegin I will probably not I I watched
I tried watching a couple of classic
Doctor Who stuff and it just was it I
have a I've trouble with olders show
you're a poser 100% oh no I have a
trouble I've trouble with pacing of
older movies and TV shows I like I like
but things fast it's that being modern
and classic who's alright just was
nothing
yep they're gonna be hipster closer to
cream look I didn't mean to start
something Jack they were gonna say it
anyway I watched some episodes I watched
the first like five episodes and it was
really drawn out like literally it took
five episodes for like the doctor to go
from the TARDIS to the first city like
five episodes like I'm walking through
the woods you know because that's how
old bbcgirls work
citizen Spain citizens famed
citizen Spain is great over Jay yes
Berdych eseni movies my watch oh god
this is Jake give me a movie watch does
he say he'll watch any movie no but I
assume they'll just watch it if you
recommend it right now oh my god oh well
if you're in the mood for just a
feel-good fun movie Cannibal Holocaust
I'm gonna say you will not regret
watching Cannibal Holocaust it'll give
you a very sunny disposition and make
you happy to be alive so go check out
anime Holocaust and maybe maybe follow
it up with happiness by Todd Salons I
mean how can you go wrong with a movie
called happiness it makes you feel happy
I can guarantee it exactly exactly
so yes that's your double feature duty
that's what I'm giving you
I want to hear that you watch both those
back-to-back if you know if you don't
come out
whistlin from happiness money-back
guarantee when you hear about the
suicide hey I've seen both those movies
and I'm okay done
so there
you ever heard of this wake in fright oh
yeah a guy he's probably oz Mike he sent
it to us we I have not watched it yet I
need to I need to just take it home it's
at the studio let's take it home and
watch it at some point cuz I know you
keep recommending it and it sounds
interesting
I haven't listened to the serial podcast
I haven't no keep hearing about it it's
a great thing okay good yeah I think
it's just that I don't have much
interested in the subject matter I don't
know do they actually talk about surreal
well it's like a fictionalized thing oh
you tell me about yeah about like a
serial killer it's like oh fuck what I
dread dragon far away didn't notice it
if you ask jay for movie recommendation
he will recommend movies with the
intention of killing you what I won't do
though is recommend a movie that is bad
these are miserable movies they make you
feel like shit but I would not recommend
a movie that I think is bad Cannibal
Holocaust is a rough watch but it's a
powerful piece of filmmaking
yes Jamis oh wait I have seen that there
is already a fan at it
of The Hobbit movies oh yeah
eight hours down to four and a half they
gotta keep cutting it down they're not
there yet not there yet I haven't
watched it of course cuz I have no
interest in revisiting the Hobbit movies
bit sure maybe in a few years I'll watch
this fan that it who knows yeah if we
can if we can get a fan at it down to a
reasonable time I'll even say three
hours three hours yeah if it's if it's
three hours are under I think I could
get behind it yeah
Jack equals wallowing again I'm sure I'm
going what am I wrong about then most
cereals not fictionalized yeah it is
we've talked about this before and you
guys said it was it was like talking I'd
you did you lie to me before when we
were talking about cereal last time it
was you the chat that told me it was
fictionalized that it was like a it was
following like an old serial murder case
and they were investigating it and these
victims I just I just don't care that
much
music is so good to me remix thank you
for subscribing Jesus Christ eight
months we very much appreciated
good god man what's wrong with you I'm
gonna tell you I wrote my Steve review
for crypt of the necrodancer yeah and
you know like I was trying to find
something fun funny to do with my review
yeah and so I said you know I started
the review on Windows my tank turpino
said though the game's really good but
most more importantly the soundtrack is
so amazing it completely removed all
Taylor Swift songs from my head and then
I wrote the rest of the review slipping
in names of Taylor Swift songs so every
Taylor Swift song from her new album is
in the rest of the review no that's
funny and I really appreciated it I
really enjoyed writing that I thought it
was
oh and someone is saying they're already
working on a three-hour cut once the
blu-ray I am I was surprised to hear
that there was already a cut I mean I
they maybe they had a like an Oscar
screener or something great but I know
it was low quality it wasn't like HD or
anything okay so yeah get that blu-ray
out cut those three movies down to under
three hours and I will watch them
absolutely I agree I will watch that as
soon as it's at a reasonable rundown
what should i watch first plan nine or
terror in Beverly Hills terror are you
talked about like as a double feature
like you're gonna watch both of them but
one order to do it in
I would I would assume what that is he
only has time about 100k if you're only
gonna watch one and you're gonna watch
the other one later yeah
terror girls well I would say save that
for a second cuz it's the better one
plan lines like a classic bad movie it's
fine and actually watch because it's the
better one what you want to work up to
the better one plan nines the classic
you watch that and then you watch
something that you're less familiar with
everybody knows about plan nine right
all right last round that I do this I'm
done okay
but I guess basically what we're saying
is you have to watch tear in Beverly
Hills at some point yes I would say
watch that over plan money yes if you're
only going to watch one plan nine is fun
to watch be fess when everybody's
throwing paper plates and yelling things
to the screen sure it's not fun to just
watch at home I think I tried once in
high school and I first learning about
Ed Wood yeah it's kind of bad it's fun
like with a group in a group setting yes
I think I would agree with you it's just
kind of bad yeah the the backstory of it
is more interesting which is why
partially why Ed Wood is such a great
movie
and plan 9 is like the appetizer for a
good ban with these what there is here
it's it's the Citizen Kane of bad movies
it's like you know you have to watch it
because it's it's the you know the one
that everybody talks about everybody
references true now true no yeah you say
you love cinema you have to watch
Citizen Kane I guess you know regardless
of how you feel about it I'm gonna have
to see it you have to watch it and
understand it's relevant yes if you love
shitty movies you gotta say no yes I
agree
so yeah both Jay and I are saying
wheedle like terror from Beverly Hills
way more entertaining way more
entertaining a better bad movie yeah we
just disagree on when you should watch
better
the Ocho knows if if you you should
watch Citizen Kane I I personally find
it to be very boring I love it
Jay loves it so there but you should if
you are a fan of movies you should watch
it to understand the relevance yes it is
one of the first movies - oh my god yes
cold ham cot again Co Hagen cold ham Co
Hagen go ahead good thank you for
subscribing these past six months
we very much appreciate it in any case
what's that the villains name and Total
Recall Co Hagen yeah yeah cold ham
cohaagen I'm not calling ya cogan
what do you watch first plan 9 or tear
in Beverly Hills the answer is disco God
okay I like Cameron Beverly Hills more
than disco Godfather but they're both
pretty entertaining teryn Beverly Hills
is something special is the Godfather
blowing no I really like about it I know
some people who think it's boring but I
really liked it I watched it for the
first time like 10 years ago yeah and I
like like I understood why everyone
loved it
like I thought it was a you know a great
movie in a lot of ways but I didn't
personally connect with it yeah so I
need to revisit it I saw the second one
for the first time last year which is
everyone says that one's better and yeah
that's a great movie yeah but I need to
revisit the first one and I've still
never seen the third one everyone always
says like the third one you know
comparatively it's horrible but it's
still like a really good movie but
everyone talks about it like it's
complete shit because just because it's
not I got a father part too sure so what
I have the box set or these days I need
to watch it
space come over saying that he doesn't
like mob movies in general he thought
even Scarface was boring and by the way
I kind of agree that scarf again I'm
talking about older movies having a
different pacing yeah
Scarface is like this super like violent
intense movie but because it's older it
still seems very slow and dull really I
think it is hmm I think it does so like
I I'm with his baseball is what I'm
saying like I I don't like any Brian De
Palma me movie feels dull no I like it
but it's just it's slow I didn't
understand people that treat it like a
serious movie like people talking about
like The Godfather and they turn a scart
like Scarface is so ridiculous right
and that's cuz it's Brian De Palma he
doesn't bear yes Taron Beverly Hills is
the one about the man who's upset about
all the doors being left over yes
Cameron Mitchell's greatest role
Radek neutral Coppola has done a decent
release since the 70s and the A's he did
my favorite movie of his which is body
double body Devils great but I would
agree that he hasn't done much great
probably since then oh my god you guys
are right I think Scarface is dull
because of video games these days it's
it's all about the video games genital
personal keep it yourself
no and I even like I like slower
methodical things but then it has to be
in a slow and methodical package as well
I think that Scarface need a little more
excitement it was it's not saying it
wasn't exciting I should know that that
this is no place for nuanced and complex
opinion this everything is terrible or
everything's wonderful
it's true
Oh Jack yeah
Lando was taken says Jack right I'm done
is that Jack hey somebody else wanted to
do something I'm done about this yes
pre-vet yeah free bet I can I can I
never even got to like the second zone I
can get them all three so why is it this
is something that always bothers me when
you hook it your computer up to the TV
yeah
why is it not on the edges that so
bothersome to me that's not quite
foreign to the TV okay so straight well
I guess you found out exactly what
resolution the TV isn't something that
in the present perfect sure it's just
strange cuz you know if this hooked up
to a completely different monitor at
home of course of course
you could set this right it's just not
set right is my guess hmm that's all
anything else a for I click on I'm done
with a stream button well we should we
should do our customary thinking what
they do something good they came and
they watched our thing it seems like
they just bitch about thanks a lot they
do that they did that to it but you
might as playing the wrong games if I
was playing the wrong I think they're
terrible people
they're probably terrible people but
there are terrible people I can see that
so thank you for all the new subscribers
thank you to all the old subscribers
thank you to everyone else just came up
to watch me we really appreciate it all
of you have a very good night
