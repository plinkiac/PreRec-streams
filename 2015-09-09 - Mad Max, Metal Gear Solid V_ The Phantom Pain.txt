[Part I]
yeah fucking I'm starting early today
jack will be here later uh I'll write
about some probably probably before 8:00
somewhere between 7:30 and 8:00 is
Jack's ETA and Here I am at the studio
and rather than um don't kill an hour
and a half two hours waiting what is it
already seven all right you like an hour
waiting I'm just gonna start early this
whatever
all right don't fullscreen you're
probably saying fullscreen but I'm not
saying this great I'm saying a window
about fuck you fuck you game
city the opening cutscene enjoy it
it is known that the world fell and the
most people in it died
the dead will not suffer the hardships
of a terrible world which reminds those
born into this l have no remembrance of
anything else those who survived those
that are truly broken they know
what was before
how's everyone doing tonight yeah I'm
sorry from the start it's funded I'm
actually testing out the feasibility of
someday doing a no depth from because I
like no deference I find them
challenging I find them fun and I'm
gonna try and level up quickly I have my
safe backed up
right
Jack will be by in about an hour I think
puts his kids to bed what no I'm sure
he'll be by okay then where I was here
rather than waiting around and you just
start the stream now why would I was one
such man one who had lost and and to
this he had lost his sanity his was a
never ending journey away from the
phantoms of his past he believed he
could silence the cacophony in his mind
and find peace beyond a place he called
the plains of silence he now had the
vehicle the weapons the provisions in
the fortitude that he only needed a few
and here there was but one place to go
technically I guess it's a movie tie-in
game because it's a movie franchise but
really has that much to do with the
movie and I got licensing the franchise
more so than making a movie tie-in
maxi's ripped chata sir oh yeah if you
survive the apocalypse you're probably
gonna end up being ripped I don't I
don't think the apocalypse is gonna be
littered with fat people
that people will be food for the
survivors
won't somebody tell me answer it
how did how did scrotus survive that
both the one video game logic movie live
fiction it's worth of fiction and you'd
be surprised what the brain can survive
I mean there there have been people
who've been impaled through the skull
with a number of ridiculously large
objects that have lived I mean one of
the the piers for epilepsy is they
remove half your brain or at the very
least they they they cut the connecting
tissue between the two halves of your
brain which is basically what just
happened to that guy scrotus it looks
comical but I think technically
technically survivable you probably need
better medical care right afterwards
than the Mad Max world is capable of
providing you still
this is kind of weird I'm used to
playing this I'm pretty pretty much any
game in my PC with a logitech a Logitech
controller which is kind of a
PlayStation controller knock off right
now I'm playing with absolutely roids
xbox pad everything feels weird really
really weird
that Mad Max versus Big Boss well I
think Mad Max is technically undefeated
big boss well it's at some point he does
he does get beat by his janky-ass clone
like like twice so that would be in the
pre solid Metal Gear games before Solid
Snake was a clone of big boss strike I
know you'll find me and dismantle me no
no Chum buckets not stupid
dogs bleeding out I can fix it
but I do my best work in my sanctum of
the car I need wire to fix my buggy Dan
I can show you where they took the
black-on-black way to a phone boil up
that pack but before you go grab some
quick sake you must be running on fumes
does does that's not a metal gear solid
5 spoiler that's a a metal gear on the
nest spoiler that has nothing to do with
5 big boss has been around for 30 years
he was the villain in classic metal gear
yes you eat dog food like like in like
in the road warrior food
all right now I'm gonna try and level up
quickly like I said I'm kind of flying
around with seeing how feasible a ain't
no debt rose and I might try and level
up quick and I'm gonna take these early
fights pretty easy because I'm trying to
get the level up token for undefeated
straight for not taking any damage in
battle so I'm not I'm not even taking
many chances in this early section even
though I could probably deal with these
guys a lot more efficiently as far as
somebody earlier said this every game
need a prophecy I I think I think that
that the Hunchback the guide chumbucket
he's he's gotta nuts I don't think there
is prophecy
fatback's doesn't care because the guy's
willing to build him a car because he
thinks that's what the proxy wants me to
do
hey guys without taking any damage right
now with that that's six so I've gotta
find two more guys to kill without
taking any damage from anything
yeah I'm using a gamepad PC because this
is a game this is a gamepad centric game
I mean this is kind of free flow of
fighting built for a gamepad also
driving also better with a gamepad when
it comes to aiming I am I am Pro Mouse
why
Kojima basically said ignore the NES
Metal Gear games I think he meant been
Vaness one only is the nest one is a
terrible part of the the actual original
version of Metal Gear which was it on
the MSX or something weird but story
wise I think they're very much canon
Metal Gear Solid which is the only the
only 3d one I've played in full I think
takes place directly after the 2d metal
gears
my buggies just over here follow me
I seem to talk more naturally no then I
used to in solo streams on got a little
bit more experience but edit it's a
little bit less awkward though I'm
probably gonna start focusing on the
game at some point because I'm trying to
as early as I can I'm trying to get the
defeat eight guys in a fight without
losing any health then I'm gonna
instantly try and get to be twelve guys
in a fight without losing any health and
then I'm gonna parlay that right into
the beat fifteen guys that was any hope
I'm doing
so do I get my compact sooner I'll be on
love why well a man here we arrived in
time to save your back from spotter
yes therefore that looky-look boys he
may be able to spot your car did did
rich ever give his opinion of fury road
but you don't listen to many of her
streams then it gets salivated all over
that yes jack will be here later
it'll be on our normal nonsense
BRABUS always keeps the best parts of
himself you know but he's not here now
you see I I don't see the land okay I'm
getting my car back
wait is there an actor I would love to
see play Batman um no that man is
probably just stick to being animated I
don't I don't think anybody's ever gonna
top the DCAU Batman top how fast it's
that that Bruce Timm Paul Dini and Kevin
Conroy magic
good cover perfect nice to build a car
come yes much to show you what is this
place
yeah Sydney declare the pre 60
controller that's gonna it's totally
gonna fucking throw me off big deal
when you're ready Saint my holy hideout
awaits
come come on sing us a hallucination
you come true the angel made steer by
the fire that moves the piston by the
tranny on Ojai for the clam and the
u-joint blessed be her she lawyer's
office
you say no car it's just a missing parts
no knowledge from the numinous it's my
she wills herself upon this world look
person in shed this game really isn't
that linear I mean I'm I started from
scratches all the early parts miss
hearing tutorial ask type stuff after
this first century it's pretty much open
world stuff for testing Springs shocks
thanks story he's really not focused on
that much his story is build your car
open up new areas that's the story we
would officio my journey where it is
but what I like to see in a Mad Max
sequel I will leave that entirely up to
George Miller because that man knows
what he's doing and whatever any any
idea I could come up with for a Mad Max
sequel was 30 times stupider reason than
anything George Miller was business
probably has in store I don't even know
if you need water fury road is pretty
good you know hey you know what you do
besides doing another three-hour long
car chase which was amazing but my
answer is there there are smarter people
than me who can figure that out yes I
know this cans going to be empty but I
want to loot this area because it's
another you know looting looting areas
there's another thing that'll get me
another level up token
whoever was here is long gone now along
with anything of news every every ten of
those like accomplishments things you do
why and gain more damage more more
health she's out of gas
take it easy take it easy shouldn't be
three guys sir that's not good I
actually need that's the eighth guy and
I actually need to lose health before
it'll acknowledge that I beat eight guys
in a row I can't I can't I can't go from
eight directly into twelve which is
stupid jump on a fire that burned me no
no I won't burn me oh great now I gotta
lose health because normally there are
three dudes there no there's only two
that's obnoxious I can walk on fire I
can walk on fire that's not good damn
I gotta lose health before the next
fight
Hilary all the way to the rim praises
she's full but let's bring an extra
oh let us make haste before the nightly
hunters return ok fall off something
here I'm actually trying to take damage
now this is ridiculous
nope
look
no talking closer to it hopefully I
won't die there we go I'm to see
untouchable speed I know eight enemies
without taking damage now I can work on
the twelve enemies without damage that
was that was a joke that was those
comical
don't put it around so let's make this
one count
murder on sight
this is there a movie I would love doing
her own commentary track on a space cop
looking forward to that we're getting
there
attraction
so we're not used to a 360 pattern
their prize right for their taking go
quickly
oh holy way to get up there it's through
the hose cave tunnels
get the kind place down here I'll lower
the body onto it gas cans do not explode
well in fiction they do in fiction gas
always explodes that's just that's just
accepted that's it's the same thing
that's like shooting a car gas tank
makes a large explosion really not any
kind of reality just spills gas all over
the floor
that may or may not excite you probably
won't ignite back you know movie logic
we accept these things
still works too
am I looking forward to football season
no I'm not because I live in Wisconsin
and I hate Green Bay
so football season for me is horribly
obnoxious
especially when the Bears suck and
they're probably going to mid last
season another rebuilding again so fuck
football
now working that no damage thing again
ah fuck all right
try again with the next group of dudes
fuck you for starting early fuck you too
you missed out on me here alone not
talking about anything interesting play
my Maxim
I'm so sorry for Dec that's gonna show
up I don't know a Tish and it's gonna be
a full-on stream you'll be fine you'll
be fine
oh well
why is turning her Xbox controller
oh whoa up
head-on collision
oh yeah
too much nuki says the Xbox analog
sticks a notoriously but I thought the
Xbox controller was absolutely perfect
it needs repairs
you wanna know what I think of the game
I I like it I like quite a bit I got I
got a tie up I don't hate the middle
gear I'm not saying that but III want to
play this more than the new Metal Gear
this game has won the battle for my
heart Mad Max or Batman Arkham Knight
met max look other than the story
I don't think Knight is all that great
the car combat sucks I actually enjoy
the car stuff more in this game plus
it's more appropriate for the franchise
and even though this is take the Arkham
combat I think I think Arkham combat or
free-flow combat that's just the thing
now that's like I think I mentioned this
before on a stream like back in the the
middle to late 90s Doom clothes were a
thing first-person shooters were all
called gym class eventually it just
became its own genre I think that's
gonna happen with the free flow combat
I'm just gonna get used to that as its
own thing now and honestly the free flow
combat I mean it's different enough they
they managed to make it feel a bit more
brutal which is appropriate for max
hitting one guy in the face repeatedly
moreso than jumping all over the place
it's a little bit different
but I don't I don't think the Arkham
games can hold on to this is their thing
forever
it's it's just it's a thing now and we
we have to deal with that
I wouldn't want only Arkham combat 100%
of the time but if other games use it
okay if if as long as they can find ways
to put their own spin on it
got the jack
we're just scared it'll be easy with a
heart there yes first if we don't weaken
their numbers why it'll mean the end of
you me and the magnum opus all right
see those metal monsters slowest water
flies would have loved to mark their
turf bring them down for a good rally
Kadena jump front but it sure would
I'm going white he got to pick up that
scrap
did I ever play Halo one or the series
hero is a first-person shooter on a
console so you have to use a gamepad so
fuck halo yes I know halo 1 had a PC
port but none of the other games doing
some fucking I need that shit
first-person shooters with a pad fucking
awful fucking awful ridiculous control
scheme
fuck analogue FPS controls yes aiming
with a thumb stick fucking nightmare
it's like it's like it's like jogging
and fucking hip-deep molasses Oh
shooters where you can't use a mouse
terrible unless they've got auto and
then it's not even really a shooter
gamepad is an inferior tool for FPS
utterly inferior in every conceivable
way
it's like it's like eating soup with a
fork
let's say
gates defended war crier sniper out
front that's all
Tampa's live defenses I'll deal with
them before interim I I know you can
play in the first Halo on PC but say I
really liked it and I wanted to play the
sequel's and I can't because you have to
use a fucking game pad on the console
for every other Halo game so fuck that
I'm not doing it fucking
now
Thank You speech
amen
nope nope no I don't want to aim at the
Schmucks
I want to aim at the guy that's bluffing
room
what mess you got
now stop liking that record and fuck you
all right black black is gone they have
nothing
fuck the fuck d12 guys without taking
damage then gonna fucking fuck it all
fuck it all
well I well I have a good rich needs to
do this is a surprise secret no death
run like Dead Rising maybe maybe that's
what I'm testing the waters for with
this got to get to that pump and destroy
it
Mike game might take too long to try and
do a no death run huh
well I guess I don't have to do
everything I skip out on action I guess
there's nothing saying I have to 100%
and I'm waiting for the storm to start
sending other than this level of things
a checkbox
I'm having a shitty fucking game
I'm blaming stream distraction that's my
official excuse
jack-jack will get here eventually
after I take care of the section of the
game I'm probably gonna go make sure
jadynn block up downstairs
you know it's entirely possible the jack
is outside right now unable to get in
that's a possibility
had a funny one nothing jack and again
what do you want time is built to this
wonderer your path however crooked has
led you straight to here our work yours
and mine
must soon commence come find me when
your spirit is ready
almost have a 15th history fuck you fuck
you
Daniel pump make it so that there's no
reason for them to come back
I am playing a shitty game right now
fuel storage one candle district
all right I'm gonna go make sure the
Jack can get in make sure we're not
locked up down our prayer
I'm back
one from the tunnels I need to find him
all right
how terrible am I do I don't love one up
yeah bad
we got five of those tokens I could have
as many as like eight if I weren't
second
now to begin my work
there's something that's doing before we
turn back funny but we've got all we
need
pies tall artwork for the magnum opus
it's not for you to understand I see you
have your secret reasons cuz I think
fate favors old chum
if you have to wonder solo please detect
this flare when you need old Tom Waits
Thai words
start with a car I do this alone
oh never mind all chumbucket never mind
never mind the old black finger his
sacred quest
I should try driving in first person
that sounds horrible I've always hated
driving in first person he games
maybe we would like an oculus if you
could look left or right I would be fine
with it ruin past you say you seek the
plains of silence but do you not wonder
them right now the remains of your life
a perpetual flight an escape from all
that is human
until one day because it's the other way
to drag in real life yeah I don't feel
that way you can drive in real life but
in real life it's really easy to turn
your head left and right to see what's
what's off to your side
what's so in a game well come much
before this purpose to you is made
manifest you know nothing of me
the bond you at June of the June of
drifting I'll fuckin Terrace you FLE
them Weiss these past phantoms and the
madness that crawls inside
you've come to Griffith for a reason
deep inside twisted around horrors from
which you run lies your strength Griffi
can help help your venture down to where
you dint go yourself and your true
promise uh chat cars are easier to turn
real life because you're usually not
driving at 200 miles an hour usually
usually slow down before you make that
turn
Oh Saul I got four tokens yeah I'm doing
like crap crap this fuck
Sporty's yes this is a new run I'm just
kind of testing the waters for a no
death run certainly not gonna do tonight
I don't even know if we're gonna keep
playing this ones Jax shows up under see
how easy it was the level up quick and
I'm not doing good so far but I think
I'm just having a bad run sided Oh
any trouble launching just steals her
away from us
no time to waste then we've gotta build
yes yes we do
we've done righteous work saved we have
what we need to install their nitrous
boost
leave
why doesn't max have a dog oh look at
that there's a dog max does have a dog
so suck it suck it what does it feel
like to be wrong horribly horribly wrong
much I've done yet sort of set of 900
people or 50 years however many people
we got this chat I don't know
Doug did die in the second movie however
this game doesn't give any shits about
any empty Mad Max continuities so there
you go
now he has a dog
fury road doesn't even give a shit about
the continuity I mean in fury road Mad
Max has a daughter who died though in
the earlier movies it was a son so not
know any be damned
know what I wish
that's the last back to my
yeah was the same director writer I mean
obviously he just doesn't give a shit
about continuity he cared about making a
fun movie today that's what he did
he succeeded
I don't know what his reason is for
changing it from a son to a daughter but
by god the car
all right came here from a scrap you
guys can suck it
some of those unfastens just feel so
brutal it's appropriate
OOP listen
how long have I been playing like an
hour
I started at seven seven ish
and I don't know it's because I'm
distracted because I'm streaming and
trying to talk I'm not having a great
run
nothing I'm terrible either
now do you not want to look at a
shirtless dude
Oh nobody here why didn't they spawn
it's so weird this means a whole lot the
song
no that was full that's nice
I do not know where Jack is right this
moment I'm sure he's around somewhere I
fully expect him to show up he didn't he
didn't cancel on me
at least I hope he didn't he's my ride
home
I got no updates from him one way or the
other
jack is playing rocket League according
to the chat I could see that Jack is
stuck at home until his wife gets there
so if he's playing rocket League it
might be because he's killing time
and that's understandable hey you push
the wrong guy max
yeah there has been scavenged
that's a bad story sure they have this
becomes more of a oh come and see come
and see you'll say yes with his hands
and the blessings of the sacred cylinder
she's come to life
my sweet combustor what I told you
VI don't be six yeah exactly
hate is the magic number you and me
we're gonna land a big chief a bonafide
bad boy ah 429 cubic inches 460 horses
holy rolling nobody could touch you on
the blacktop pay your knight right you'd
be evergreen eternal where is it
let's go there No
you got to love this hunchback is
basically building max a car for nothing
and Mad Max is yelling at him because he
didn't have a v8 and you can't put him
there that's great max isn't sure as he
should be
we have the car we need to go
you know a safe place somewhere we can
rebuild I
G of the great white we can make a deal
it doesn't sell site now the best we can
do I don't think we have a choice
what is this place this is part of a
great ride he's turning we're so fucking
like everywhere outs in this realm this
is white ass peoples turns Gaston is
going to be a location in this I haven't
gotten there yet
in my and my other save file but it's on
the map
I can only assume we go there
I will say this game feels too populated
for a Mad Max boy it's a little bit odd
why not here
I don't think we're going to see the
bullet farm nothing nothing in the game
is implied that bullet farm is a
location that will happen also the cars
in this game need fuel which is a nice
touch cans almost empty horseless
Oh what did you get here
oh my god they're swarming
the apocalypse has never been this
crowded before
that's my scrap
and you chew
Oh God
fuck the six months controller and your
white ass terms because I because I move
the analog stick a bit too far back when
I turn fucking off oh god damn it
you know it's gonna get punched in the
face ain't me how many people are going
to stop me on my way to the fortress in
this deserted apocalyptic wasteland how
many times is that going to happen
are you
so these are the the things you do that
level you up you don't there's not like
a general experience and you just keep
killing guys keep getting experience
it's you have to do these little
unlockable things kill X number of guys
this way and then you get a little token
and then every ten one of those you get
a full level
or minute charts the next one I got
Jesus Christ
I got a ways to go
his fury road was amazing
I so wish I had cheats quarters unlocked
so I even get your all your wonderful
riches but I can't because I haven't
seen gene yet I've been fuckin around
with cars show up now fuck off you're a
jerk
I'm gonna kill you just for showing up
too early damn I wish I wish I could
plunder you properly don't go over there
tires
so much crap fuck up
it's still a lot of screwing not as much
as I could have gotten though bring the
whole thing in intact
such a waste such a waste
oh god damn it
sniper
oh you're so dead you're so fucking dead
and I'm not gonna fucking shoot that
face which is
tires tires
really
whoa I keep hitting the wrong button
when I picked it up and fuck that fuck
that it really feels like fiction up
should be B but pick shit up bees is
shit your shotgun and I didn't have I
didn't have I didn't drink from my
canteen like few minutes ago that would
have killed me
all right let's get to the fucking me
before so if I see another one of those
fucking scrap cars I'd get a ton of
money and not just a pittance
that scratches off
take it back good German
adness
fast fire
ah fix the car
you know I'm getting at a higher than
normal number of car lights I pay I
think that's just one of those things
having an odd game cast out from the
bonfire their leader gee judge me and
found me wanting no fighting spirit left
broken a knowledge of their battles yes
town so what'll it be help me with this
loot and split it or Culp's me take it
all
sharpshooters and scavenger hordes to
come
J has not played this game
I don't so much help those guys out
you got
more are you guys or did I not get full
credit for the last batch I don't know
weird set the nearest water yeah it's a
nurse water that's ways way now
well I do need wanna wrestle anyway
all right
yes we're back to quite right and if
anything but I have interesting things
to say all the time till then yeah what
you want out of me just to say random
shit spleen there I'm not quiet I said
spleen
pick up the weapon really she
for the record
whoa sneaking up on me huh
one one single bullet
I read the authority no I have not
you know I just talked about the heat
death of the universe I don't know you
really do I need people back there again
and when we won't we just be rehashing
the same ground I mean next time I have
something interesting and depressing to
talk about I'll probably just talk about
it there's plenty of depressing things
in this world I would worry something
will come up those guys one of the water
are still there
I have no interesting stories to tell
look this is what happens sometimes they
do a solo stream I'm I'm talked out
don't know don't know what to talk about
I'm sorry
bring them out
oh well it's fine I'm fine with that
Jack should be on his way
so there will be talking I need one more
before I him up great max a bit
you know what do you got on you tell me
you got some shotgun chills and use some
shotgun shells if Jack doesn't show up
what direction should you scream and one
my solo streams that I know they're not
great I'd ever never laid claim to
greatness but would you really say
they're that bad yeah or like that
forties I know I'm gonna have to scrap
things I'm not gonna be able to bring it
it's right unlock that for it first
this isn't far through this game at all
I kind of started a fresh one before we
Street I was curious undoable and no
deathrun would be in this
I kind of started out hoping the level
up quick leveling up quick has not
happened but dying hasn't happened
either
I'll keep an eye on her
one day they all came down all the
planes what do I think of the Fermi
paradox oh that's an interesting one the
Fermi paradox states that just just
doing the math the what's the other
what's the other doing when you figure
out how many aliens there should be like
even even without Lightspeed somebody
did like the math that the universe
should be pretty much fully colonized
with some kind of intelligent alien life
by now even even moving slower than the
speed of water I mean the universe
should be teeming with intelligent life
and so the Fermi paradox asked why why
haven't we met the madness if life
should be everywhere where the fuck is
it and I don't know what the answer is
nobody in since why is the fervor they
don't science doesn't know there's no
answer
a bunch of possible answers I mean we
could be the only intelligent life in
the galaxy one of the other answers is
that intelligent life has a tendency to
destroy itself with like nuclear war and
whatnot or intelligent life just doesn't
evolve all that often if at all we can
be first you could find videos online
that talk about the Fermi paradox better
than I could

[Part III]
and I know I'm running out of time you
know right now Isaac is kind of my
is my late night game if if Lisa's ever
watching something she's been watching a
show that she's really into right now

was like metal gear but if she's ever
watching something else's pick up Isaac
so for a couple hours a day but yay
stream that's right Tiberius Kirk yay
stream yay everybody hates us everybody
hates us cuz we don't much care for
metal gear for reasons that are
seemingly valid but hey it doesn't
matter
Oh family if you use the seeds you don't
put the achievement oh well that's good
to know because I haven't been
eventually would have broken down and
used the seed and then I wouldn't have
gotten the achievement room what the
fuck I would have sent so many angry
tweets
oh I know mr. Jesmond I like that and
you know again rich and I don't want to
take away any one enjoyment of the game
we're just trying to articulate our own
feelings these fair Jack's feelings on
lot stronger than it's true my feelings
are a lot stronger than I am more on the
fencing yes than jackets and I've gone
to I've gone to full over contempt
there's a lot of individual things I
like and for some reason as a whole I'm
not super into it right and I agree with
rich on the individual things that I
like about the game and like I talked
about on Sunday
I love nights the individual missions I
love planning the missions I love the
the reconnaissance I'm I just love
sneaking and oh I being sneaky so much
being sneaky is so much fun sandstorms
oh my god I fucking love Sam still yes I
was on a big mission recently and it was
like a huge area yeah and and I was at
the final objective and there was a
there was a guy in a roof and I you know
quickly you know grabbed him
interrogated him and he said there were
some blueprints but the blueprints were
in a building way on the other side of
the arena fucking I need these
blueprints before I complete the mission
so I had all the way over to the
blueprints and I'm into his wide-open
area and there's a ton of guys and his
sandstone comes and I say in stone
blocks everyone's vision yeah so
basically just fucking run it was it was
wonderful but then I took so long to go
get the blueprints that a different guy
who I had just knocked out and didn't
want to Fulton him out yet because other
guys were around him hadn't woken up oh
my god oh my it was an alarm got raised
it was a hole to do is great it was
fucking great the individual missions
are so much fun but there's this other
part to the game that has now started to
take over the game base management
cut-scenes story all those things I
really fucking hate I'm going to
continue to try and ignore base
management as much as I can
other than maybe trying to get somebody
to build me every now and then well
that's the problem is to build certain
equipment you need your your individual
parts of your base to be at certain
levels and so then it's really important
to like make sure the right people are
on the right teams to get rid of
troublemakers when there are some and
apparently there are special rules for
troublemakers where if there are two
troublemakers on a team that cancel each
other out and so then you need to make
sure that there's an even number of
troublemakers if there are troublemakers
it sounds like a pain in the ass and
exactly the kind of thing I don't want
to do at a tactical espionage stealth
game this is where I am rich yeah this
is where I fucking am and I'm not like
looking online for like strategies or
anything I'm just listening to what the
game tells me that's what I'm doing only
the things that game time yes I know
twitchplayspokemon that there's a button
to automatically assign everyone look
but then why have that part of the game
like you're supposed to be the big boss
you're supposed to be in charge and the
game tells you to be in charge and
manage your guys so I'm listening to the
game I understand completely that I can
ignore all of this but I'm doing my best
to do what the game tells me to do I'm
letting the game bring me in and I hate
it
live and learn and again the fan ATO's I
know I don't have to do everything the
game suggests but the thing is if why
are they suggesting something that is
tedious it shouldn't this just be if if
the things that are bothering me about
the game are tedious by nature and can
be very easily skipped then why are they
even part of the game no I played a lot
of it today and some extra I'm just
extra riled up about the middle of your
day go get some fucking water my beer
now that you guys are giving me before
you know that part of the game can be
ignored would be like it'd be like if
you were watching a movie like oh you
know this movie was pretty good except
for like there's these two seams that
are really out of place and someone goes
well you know on the DVD you can just
skip those seams you know well let's
this part of the fucking movie that's
it's still a problem because it's part
of the movie and of course I could just
skip those scenes and not be bothered by
those specific scenes but then why did
they put anything you want or agendas
here I'm just here having fun
see me fail at metal you do it
oh my god that would be so awesome I
don't know how Ronda Rousey acts but I
did hear that leftover beefcake did you
hear that Ronda Rousey the the fire the
Ultimate Fighter is starring rumor is
starring in a Roadhouse remake
I love Roadhouse I'd love to you know
you know I mean it's not a good movie
but it's one of those that you should
see I saw Jays face punching montage I
think about Roadhouse yes if they can
make if they can make a dumb fucking
action movie with it with a chick
bouncer I would love that
who knows how good of an actress she is
she might be terrible but it would be
very fun to watch I am I'm a little
burned out on metal gear right now and
I'm sorry that I'm bringing this into
the stream no no people what people are
just catching up with my with my metal
gear thing you know but again this is
someone you know that rich and I've been
talking about which is like why am I so
upset that I've been playing this game
that's what I'm trying to figure out YUM
when I know there's a lot of things I
should love about it right
and so I've been doing my best to
articulate my points and and of course
there are counter points and and if you
like the world and if you're you know
you've played all the games we like the
characters and you just like being in
the world
I think there's a lot of stuff that a
veteran of the Metal Gear series will
look over it's like oh that's just Metal
Gear thank you
but as someone who hasn't played really
played a game since then Metal Gear
Solid 4 PlayStation 1 I'm just fucking
pissed off and that's Metal Gear is not
a good enough explanation for
what's going on I'm getting harassed
constantly
I don't want to fuck around with cars so
wasting ammo killing them all
oh great now the snipers on their way oh
fuck you fuck off
oh no CAMAC scene it's fine if you want
to bring it up like obviously like metal
gears the big game right now everyone's
talking about it and that you know I
guess obviously I'm bringing up a lot of
my negative points now or forever hold
your peace
I'll fucking hold my peace and I I do
want to reiterate that I really do enjoy
the individual missions like just
planning my route of attack yep trying
to figure out like oh you know if I get
caught here where can I escape to fine
you know her interrogating all the guys
and finding all the extra like items for
your base I love all that I just can't
bring myself to do more than one or two
missions in fact this is the thing this
is the real thing but the rate I'm going
it'll take me five years that's a good
investment but each individual mission I
really do enjoy I have a lot of fun I
even have a thought a lot of fun just
walking around in the world just Nina
riding your horse looking for plants
fucking I'll cut that plant okay so I
don't wanna I don't want to sound like
I'm 100 percent shitting on the game
overall I don't much care for right now
but it's not a hundred percent thing
there are aspects at the door
oh yeah how these guys are painted
you know mr. Schine smile I'm not angry
about the cutscenes here here's what
bothers me about the cutscenes is I want
some of that crazy in the game you know
I what crazy girl goes crazy I want some
of it here goes crazy enough we can have
that up your game that doesn't go crazy
like you know for example let's take
blood-borne as a counterpoint right the
entire game is fighting these huge
grotesque monsters they're fighting
monsters right some small monsters some
big monsters and they have these little
cutscenes in blood-borne that have big
monsters in them but in Metal Gear we
have these cutscenes with ridiculous
characters and and over-the-top anime
asks I finest but then the game is
standard military dry espionage drama
and so you can be silly you can be
serious you can be a mixture but be
consistent don't go from one to the
other from one extreme to the other and
that's that's my problem with the
cutscenes is they they are not connected
to the gameplay so far maybe maybe it
gets there later again I'm only at 15%
of the game but so far the cutscenes
have been demons riding unicorns and the
gameplay is
because they own key strategic military
document I would be so fine with just
that yeah exactly
right right I would be fine with that
but this is my problem I was so upset
when I got attacked fighting like mr.
ghost zombie men yeah well I rescued a
powa but sunglasses back I was having a
nice dry there disparate they're not
connected well of course but that
doesn't mean it
am I only complaining about Metal Gear
cutscenes because I have to watch them
for review purposes maybe I'm not gonna
I'm at this point I've decided I'm not
gonna watch them for review purposes
I've already decided I hate the
storytelling seeing more of it isn't
going to change whatever the next time I
see a fire zombie I'm torn out mm-hmm
that's true I did I just ran it did you
fight those zombies in that first level
I tried yeah I just ran away to I've
died a couple times and then I ran away
yeah I died a couple times it's just
really annoying isn't ruined like pretty
perfect
stolen chaos who says he doesn't
understand all the Metal Gear discussion
when we're not playing it at the moment
we are both playing it also and I'm
gonna go out on a limb and say Mad Max
doesn't have that much to discuss
the thing you need to take away from
metal gear is rich would rather be
playing that max right now that is true
in general I'm getting more enjoyment
out of this yes
fan fan of toast I would be more
accepting of the fantasy elements of
Metal Gear if it didn't have the hard
military military aesthetic what I'm
asking for is is one or the other either
the game is a dry military espionage
game or it's a fantasy anime rock but at
the at the moment they are jumping
wildly from these two disparate tones
and that makes it no good time
so I don't I thought we have the same
that is this Batman DLC right it is
almost to the combat does feel just
different enough I think saying this
earlier I think before you even showed
up
yeah then we need to stop thinking of
this as Batman combat okay it's free
flow combat is its own thing okay
the early first-person shooters after
then we're all called doom clothes right
right up to and I think including
half-life half-life was a doom clone at
some point we realized oh no this is in
fact a new genre called the first-person
shooter yes okay and this I think we're
at the point where we need to recognize
this is just a new genre of fighting
game what did you call the funny free
flow and three flow calm it's been given
okay so this is just it has a free flow
fighting mechanic yeah okay a free flow
fighter that's hard to say I think I
think that's where we're at in life the
free flow fighter oh man I can't do it
fighter I've had a drink I've had one
beer rich and I can't do it the free
flow fighter yeah rich loves zone of the
enders which is anime is fucked yes
somehow is like 20 times more down to
earth than Metal Gear other than the
giant robots really zone of the Ender's
isn't that anime all said and done
haha but also you know cuz you played
zone of the Ender's mom yeah it seemed
like it had its tone pretty well down in
the anime sector yeah you know like it
chose its horse it chosen our crazy
rainbow anime holes what I am yes yes it
wasn't trying to be at all
you're missing some scrap there's one
hit around here somewhere how do you
know it tells you five 600 that is
annoying because it's just that one I
could run around looking for it but I
don't know how long that'll take
I'll look for it you know what once you
find it then we'll switch over to middle
you well I could run around look at the
scrap or I could try and beat one more
base up mm-hmm I think I'd rather beat
another base object okay be another good
beating scrap then there's what I mean
it doesn't matter if Kojima didn't write
zone Evander's he's just a producer can
you just we were making a comparison
you're a fan of Metal Gear I think
that's great
be a fan of Miller yeah like what you
like me
we're not here to harp on that yeah
we're not here to take away your like of
Metal Gear we're discussing why we're
not into it at the moment
and I think you should you should like
whatever you like do you do you
ionic Li like Kesha that's just that
that's a thing I enjoy I enjoy kind of
shitty girly pop I love it I think it's
great I'm sure there are plenty of
reasons why I shouldn't like valid
reasons that's not gonna stop - okay
dollar sign fuck just keep saying those
things you're saying I don't know what
that's you just keep doing that she
spells she spells her name was she she
spells her s with a dollar sign
what Kesha
that's just it is
speaking of dollar signs a name I've
also been really enjoying Aesop Rock
he's a rapper he's great
well he's not great but I enjoy his out
long live I'm really listening to the
fuck out of my language with headphones
cuz he cusses a lot straight-up a lot of
cussing it's my car
what
uh-huh
the killer of scrotus cops comes in that
crack yonder you go in it Kesha doesn't
change the fact that you are factually
wrong factually wrong about what we have
given nothing but opinions so far look
to the right engines are different than
facts good people don't like when you
don't love things they love I know I
know
are you upset because we said that I've
never said I even hated the Belger right
I've just said I don't love it
I think I think he's upset because we
called Kojima the director of zona
vendors and he was only the producer
whatever who fucking cares he's got his
name on two games it's in your fucking
manner everything's fine like all the
time
it's gonna be well Joe Jack said earlier
that I think it's a bad game there are
aspects I really like rich is still on
the fence yeah we're not gonna believe
it or not we're not the same person rich
and I are we have different rulings on
things yes and everything we say or do
is like only what we individually think
and there's you know we actually we
don't have a hive mind we don't we don't
rich is still on the fence on whether or
not he enjoys the game I I have decided
I'm still going to give it a go and I'm
still going to do my best to be
objective about the game even though you
know the past 20 hours I have not much
cared for
leftover beefcake I'll never talk shit
about Road eyes I love Roadhouse
okay hold on fan a toast I'm gonna I'm
with you your I'm officially I'm delving
into your crazy well you know he's
trying to fit when you say that the game
makes you do things you don't have to do
you doing the things you don't like and
saying you didn't like them makes no
sense don't do them about some of the
tenders I thought you were wondering why
this is Jonathan and this was less anime
than Metal Gear Solid oh you don't
really care about that
oh no well and you know as far as like
the whole base management thing I'm
complaining about base management and
about going around and raising morale I
don't like that part of the game and I
could just ignore it
but like I said the game has told me
that that is important and see we're
different people I am chosen to ignore
it right right I like to pay attention
to those parts of the games like if a
game tells me that like oh you know
you'd do this he'll raise your morale
and they'll make stuff faster for you I
can only assume that going around and
getting your guys to salute you has some
sort of benefit because it gives you a
little pellet you go around some guys to
lose you and you get a little bigger
staff morale is great
you I've raised a camera just by kicking
bassoon so then I want to get that bin
every single time the game has
positively reinforced
the get your staff to salute you
it's not a game I particularly enjoy but
the game has told me that it's good and
it has positively reinforced my actions
again the the analogy is you know is the
movie the scene I don't like in the
movie
you could always skip it I could always
skip it but the game tells me it wants
me to do these things this is this is
how I'm playing the game and if it's bad
why is it in the game maybe because it's
a bad game but if you don't like it why
torture yourself then why put it in the
game I'm torturing myself because I have
to play the game for the show that's
what I'm touching
it's just a way
search police Pokemon says it's a
benefit but not a big one raising morale
this way is like collecting near
worthless collectibles in platformers
it's just something to do while passing
the time the game has given no
indication of that I'm glad I'm glad to
hear that personally because I will stop
doing it then but the game has not given
any indication to that it gives me a
pellet every time I get a guy to salute
me it gives me a reward we need to do a
few times I don't think I would waste a
lot of time doing it though I've been
the game told me I shouldn't rich why
would I not listen to the game boy games
have fun I'm not having fun doing
something in a game then it might not be
a fun game I'm probably not do it if I
don't absolutely have to
hmm then why would the game tell you to
do it in the first place it's an option
people OCD
I'm not have OCD I do like you know
things to be orderly but I would like to
end this game max Jack do I think that
the base management is inherently bad or
do I just not personally like base
management
I don't like base management it's not
what I want to do was in any tactical
espionage stealth game yeah it's like
it's like it's like work on top of your
thing you will you paid money for so I
guess to answer your question I think
both I think I don't like it in general
and it does not mesh well with the
stealthy action II part of the game it
also I don't think meshes tonally with
the game which is going for a war as
hell kind of tone a tired of war you
know that's that's kind of the look that
snake has on him at all times as he's
tired of war but literally the entire
base management thing is build a bigger
war you know so I think it doesn't mesh
tonally it doesn't mesh with the other
part of the game which is more action II
and personally I don't like it so there
you go all three the trifecta
saying the theme is revenge
the theme is revenge
the wire more my missions against the
people who hurt you directly why are we
fucking around and Afghanistan and the
theme is revenge rich Evans just drop
the mic
there is no theme I don't think there's
them knowing I don't think the theme is
revenge well I mean we have a Mad Max
jacket we have a mathematic jacket do it
yeah which oddly enough is completely
different from the one in the opening
cutscene Kojima said the theme is race
what what yeah I know I know we're
tracking down cypher like I get it that
the story is revenge I'm trying to think
of what happens in the game so so quick
lesson for everyone who's upset with us
for not believing that the theme is
revenge so theme and story are usually
different things in the story yes we are
we are getting revenge over those who
destroyed mother base and that's why
we're rebuilding mother base right but
I'm trying to think of things that
happen in the game that go along with
the theme of revenge
and it's hard for me to think of those
things
no we've been I've been watching every
single goddamn cutscene and you guys
know how much I hate cutscenes I've been
watching all of them I've been watching
all my get it why do I have to watch it
because story is an important part of
the game what if I'm not liking it then
then you have to elaborate on why you're
not liking them and even after you
elaborate on why you're not liking then
they still want to be good so nothing
matters nothing matters rich our opinion
is wrong my
most of the toys and the cassette tapes
great great I'll get right I'll get
ready fucking out that most of the story
is in an optional thing but ties
directly I'm you know I'm glad it's
optional you know I've never enjoyed
metal gear story I always thought they
were kind of full of themselves and you
don't earn that that importance just so
they're not so you have your story in
your cutscenes which is completely
separate than from the game and then you
have the real story which is in another
part of the game that's also completely
separate from the story and the
cutscenes I think that's great I think
if we could break up the story into a
few more sections that'd be great but
like the real real important story you
need to actually talk to your horse it's
a real big thing you have to find this
one interpreter who speaks for us
I'm not sure I'm really not sure I'm
dead serious I wasn't sure
yes then it says I do know that you can
listen to these story tapes during your
missions I don't want to that's not true
pet Vick I was I was completely ready to
accept the game you know so now we're to
the point of the evening where people
are accusing you know us but probably
pointed at me of not liking the game
before I was there look at that point I
upfront beep nice biased against the
story because I've always thought the
middle gear stories were full of shit
sure chair but I was ready to be
entertained by the gameplay yes and I
kind of am I'm not completely in love
and I'm wondering if it's because the
story context isn't there to fully pull
me into the world the stuff was really
great for immersion mm-hmm I think this
is you're taking your time you're paying
attention your surroundings you're very
aware of what's going around you're very
into the world yeah
and I'm wondering if it's not hurting me
that there's not a story I care about
that's sucking me fully into the world
mm-hmm so that I can be immersed in that
atmosphere yep you meet you because that
like if you're really into the story
then your missions have some weight to
them thief thief I always go back to
thief yeah I'm stole yeah because you
know very very vulnerable very fragile
very aware of your surroundings do you
have to be very immersed in that world
yeah I love taking in their worlds which
is a beautiful wonderful fantasy world
yeah and mental you're not vetted oh
it's just there
yeah
they say here so here's where we are I'm
like kicking ass yeah in Mad Max yeah
and now I have to and it's not even that
I hate about who cares I'm having fun
doing this yeah it's hard to go play
metal here when I would rather be doing
this
yeah I don't know what other games they
have now I honestly would be a little
curious to see how you play I'm trying
to play play a little mini good Metal
Gear make sure I'm saved
because I've got my mojo I was like
kicking ass yeah
or array or we could play with more
Rockets yeah yeah we can't play more
rocket
we might want
which have you played this honored I'm
going through some day and I'm probably
going to like it hmm okay all those ones
have been meaning to get around to it
when I do have like the time to get into
it I forget it exists mm-hmm I'm into
something else you know sure or there's
something I play for the show I'm not
talking about metal gear I'm just saying
in general there's been a lot of times
well this game I have to play no yep
yeah yeah I know I know dishonored is
something like a spiritual successor so
it looks neat yeah it looks like it has
a neat world I've seen somewhat like you
know some highlight reels you know
people's super amazing kills in
Dishonored and it looks awesome I miss I
miss being able to save myself in games
I hate having to be reliant on the
autosave hmm I'm with you
you know they can do both they really
can I think so yeah that yeah that has
come into play many times during Metal
Gear no mostly because sometimes if you
you know you leave the game like you
know you watch your cutscene
everything's fine and then you leave the
game and then they make Yuri watch the
little cutscene and it's like wait I've
already seen this the fury road
steelbook no no I didn't get the funeral
road steelbook
Thank You CAMAC seeing I hear you I know
but I I'm comfortable in having an
opinion and I'm comfortable with other
people's opinions and I think and you
know we've talked about this before you
know like why people get so defensive
over over opinions and the things they
like it's because we we use the things
we like to help define ourselves and so
it feels like an attack on Metal Gear is
an attack on the person who likes Metal
Gear yeah and you know I'm not I'm not
attacking anyone who likes Metal Gear
I'm explaining why I don't like it and
if you like it I think that's great but
you're wrong for not liking it the rough
no I'm glad that you found something
that you enjoy and I think finding
something that you enjoy is a really
difficult thing and so congratulations
on finding something you've enjoyed I
don't enjoy it and I tell people why I
don't enjoy it and that's part of my
life is telling people why I enjoy or
don't enjoy

[Part IV]
that's part of my life is telling people
why I enjoy or don't enjoy things that's
that's just a part of my life and people
seem to find entertainment in me telling
them about the things I enjoy and or
don't enjoy so I'm going to continue
doing that but if you enjoy that's great
and that's true human people you know
because the the chat is only text it
does feel like the things they're typing
are a little more hostile and of course
we can't talk to them we can't heal
their tone mostly with Thanatos I'm not
going to explain that again I've
explained that to him several times why
I have done the things in the game that
I don't like doing there's no reason for
me to tell you the exact same thing over
and over again chat I've kind of read
most of the Martian oh yeah Karen loves
that book and once she's around she's
actually been like reading it to me I'm
actually right near the end though I'm
updating the game right now oh you're
doing the honey
yeah during the honeybee mission I will
say I mean everything looks clean
Oh everything looks great runs like
fucking butter I've heard it runs like
butter on weaker systems and I gave them
a lot of credit for the Polish yeah the
controls and I have not read the market
I do plan on the year I've heard really
good things about it and more
importantly I want to read it before
movie talk comes out and it gets spoiled
for me nope
it's just jumping on shit yep we're
doing the bees I also did the honeybee
mission oh yeah yeah I'm actually really
curious to see how you handle the
honeybee mission
is there any good reason to fuck around
with this guy's this is your call right
yeah I'm on the map where's my where's
my fuckin objective all the way out
there yeah welcome today or not oh fuck
oh oh they got a little gun you could
fuck you could fold them out of there
that's nice oh can you Fulton the
equipment ya know there's blood-borne
DLC coming out I did not know about that
excited about that I need any excuse to
pick up blood-borne again with you much
appreciated
absolutely
you know what fails but that's a good
question why can't snake Boulton himself
like you're in a real tight situation
just balloon yourself right out of there
awesome that would be great maybe that's
an upgrade later I do love this like
when they're looking somewhere else you
know I finished blood-borne I don't
think rich just got away from it yep yep
blood-borne is takes a commitment still
enjoyed it I finish it but apparently
looking into it I I did a kind of a weak
ending
you mind me spoiling right so I'm about
I'm about to talk about the ending I
chose for blood-borne so if anyone
doesn't want that to be spoiled heads up
you get you get to kind of the final you
know the grand hunter or whatever his
name is I forget at this point and he
asks you if you want
he basically asks you if you want to die
if you want the night to be over
and I chose yeah like I chose just death
like yeah you know cuz just how I was
playing the game it was just like fuck
it I'm done with this night you know it
because you know it was that to me the
story was all just like how pointless is
all of this slang you know like all the
blood all the monsters it so he asked me
if I wanted to die and I said yes and
that was the ending apparently if you
say no you fight him and apparently if
you have you can collect umbilical cords
you can you can die from falling it
takes a while it does take if you eat
like umbilical cords that you collect
you fight like a second boss but I chose
the easy way out because that's how I
was playing the game character wise and
and what can I shoot is there a good
reason I can't shoot can't you what your
are you see oh yeah see if you raise it
up a lot you were just you were just
blocked by NECA how do you feel about
weapons switching them I hate it I hate
it again I need to pause the game when
you switch weapons I agree I think it's
very awkward I think weapon switching is
very awkward and we talked about this on
Sunday I still have not gotten it down
switching weapons is really frustrating
it's the kind of thing you need to be
able to do on the fly guys
well apparently you can just tent-like
right now you could just tap up and
switch to your other gun which is
something I didn't tap up again oh yeah
and I didn't know that so that's like a
quick switch thing but but like and I
want to switch like grenade or why don't
I have the trophies to reflect my finish
name
that's a good question people it's like
like am I supposed to get trophies for
that I don't know that's a good question
I don't know did you not save afterwards
is that a thing
no you should just get the trophy
sometimes you'd say oh no I wonder
I'll look into that that would be that
would be upsetting oh this is pointless
this has nothing to do with my objective
I'm just mad at those we've spotted this
morning myself before the mission even
started this is absurd is the folly of
war yeah oh yeah also I didn't fight the
final boss so maybe I mean you need you
only get the trophy if you fight the
final boss that could be a thing I ended
the game on my terms
I want I was ready to die I was ready
for the night to be over
yeah Thanatos I did I have recently
discovered the quote unquote fast travel
system yes no no there's it's a it's a
little hidden but I did find it and I
think you know how we talked about the
tone of this game yeah I know sometimes
it swings wildly in more of a comedy
would you like to know the fanaticism
sure is at the front of some bases
you'll find little orange platforms and
you can put yourself in a box and sit
yourself on the platform and someone
will pick you up and take you to another
base okay it's very cute and you can you
can like steal the packing slip so you
can find out their delivery schedule so
you can go to specific bases at the same
times it's very cute it's more
satisfying to ride around with your
heart
or your puppy yeah just run around with
your puppy picking plants yeah that's
what I do
also they were telling me this on Sunday
- apparently being covered in blood
increases the probability that enemies
will detect so every once in a while you
need to go back to base to shower got a
scarf please supplies you ever do best
what did I ever do what oh wait you know
I don't you know what you know what I
hate
hmm I will say this the item problem
it's like it's like making me wait for a
menu option to take hold
I'm waiting an hour yeah that's world
but if I need several things then I'm
waiting here for 20 minutes I hate that
know the time I should know
see this is way this is just a fucking
time wasted
but anyway did you ever do this that's
some breeze dude you sure right there
no you know I really like the item
dropping system again taking away like
the base let's just say in this game you
were only in Afghanistan yeah wouldn't
that be wonderful and world-building oh
yeah that you would have to wait for all
of your items to drop what you're doing
it a lot no no just get old quick yeah
but then it would make like your item
drop some more important you know it
would make it would have me mean they
had some weight
so I actually really liked their item
drop system that's worth building to me
are they all on alert because fucking
around with that one base we wouldn't
look down on your if you did come accent
is saying once he was spotted because
the support box darling that's funny
that's that's really great I've never
I've never done that before I always
back up like I'm you know I let it drop
yeah they're all running around looking
for me ah restart where are we starting
another button
apparently octo J's puppy foxy lady
turned to today congratulations on
having uh congratulations on being
flexible oh yeah I mean rich doesn't
care about any job but I am more than
willing to talk about at his keynote
today today was the big day rich doesn't
care I fuckin watch that I love it
fucking cult and Mac right here tell me
about your new shit there's been a
little bit of time talking about the new
watch OS which everyone agrees about I
think even Apple is just like yeah we're
gonna do this so big news reveals an
applique note is the iPad pro which
according to Apple is more powerful than
80% of portables pcs on the market right
now this is very powerful
they've announced the Apple pen or the
Apple pencil which is a stylus meant
specifically for the iPad which now is
not only touch and kepada touch
capacitive sensitive but also force
sensitive so like how hard you push down
on you monster
you got a monster did you just kill your
horse it's fine he's fine sure sure I'm
sure ah screw going to war and the
horrors you've unleashed upon the Afghan
people that that means you're a big
meanie
this character is the villain of the
first two Metal Gear games I'm gonna
kill a horse this guy is a nuclear
missile in a robot that's true why does
he want why does he need more missile
why does he want that
what is he hoping to accomplish am i a
terrorist no he literally has a horn
growing out of his head yes he's he's an
evil man again what is that horn when
did I get embedded in our head I don't
remember do you remember in the opening
cutscene to talk about you and I assumed
that this happened in what was the game
did you blow someone up well you so he
blew up in front of you and you they say
that fragments of that person got lodged
in your screen yeah but that's like a
black horn thing yeah that that's the
fragment that's like growing was that I
don't rub it up being in the early part
of the game though when when you're in
the hospital I don't remember that being
there I thought that happened during the
hospital no they mentioned something
about like the fragments would grow or
something I remember that it was it was
it was explained in that cutscene all
right it was a whole thing
because I found I thought her forehead
was clear at the start of that sequence
it was well we had the bandage on it
wasn't for treating no no I know there
wasn't anything protruding basically
like a lump they mentioned something
about like there was a supernatural
thing we're like supernatural bone
fragments got lodged I know I don't
remember I'm saying it's hidden under
the bandage but I mean those bandage is
the fairly flat the skull no the
bandages were the bandages were flat I
want to say they mentioned something
about spookiness in your in your skull
ring yes snake is a horn yes yes can you
give me human on that no no you see it
there though yeah that's it right there
it's he has a black horn growing out of
his head yeah well I don't know that
it's growing I think it's lodged but
it's definitely there oh I always
assumed it was it would like grow
through I see it to me that that's what
what led me to my war is hell themed
because literally you have a horn you
you you are a demon you're filled with
trouble you're filled with demon trash
you're missing an arm you're fucked up
because of the war yeah yeah
twitchplayspokemon says that he agrees
with her that the bandages did look flat
but I believe the general consensus is
that porn was supposed to be there there
you go there you go hold on to Apple
shit God really talked about today the
important thing for me is the the new
Apple TV I'm very excited about Apple TV
it's basically Apple's broke a lot of
many knees optional he's got the
information that helped me get the other
thing yeah so so if you could use your
bat cape to glide right over there and
you could probably beat up those other
guys pretty easily you got a sneak man
you got to be Sneaky's
you gots to be super sneaks I do think
the even though far cried did this - I
don't care it's a nice compromise on the
detective vision did you have to you
have to kind of earn it
you do and I like this part of the game
I love planning your attack so here's
where these guys are this mark mark this
guy mark this guy this is my favorite
part of the game right here base and the
sneaky questions getting over there how
do I get at this guy without alerting
everybody yeah I'm just gonna have to
murder everyone or use your phantom
cigar and turn it's a nighttime cigar
that will turn tonight night you don't
know I didn't know this ago the cigars
your is your time is is e'er you easier
it makes time pass more it's it's
marijuana um is is it gets you high and
then it turns into nighttime you might
want to find a hiding space because I
don't know if like patrols come and go
yeah
mister shy smile I'm not gonna tell rich
that in rich don't look at the chat
right now rich is gonna figure this out
on his own it's not a real cigar it's a
it's a it's an electronic cigar he has
he has a vape
snake vapes in this and gets totally
high listens to some tunes and that
changes your perception of time whoa
whoa rich I will not backseat game rich
rich is gonna handle the Sun is up I'm
curious to see how rich handles missions
because usually with the sneaky stuff
rich is far better than me at it
and so I'm just here to learn well well
rich is also punching shadow okay so I
keep clicking r3 or whatever sure but I
I guess I just don't run why are you
running well that's the thing why are
you running in a stealthy use your cigar
yeah oh that's okay mr. chai smell you
you didn't know if you were helping that
rich and I are not gonna play destiny
when taking King comes out there's
nothing about destiny that sounds
interesting
yes wheeze now rich is better at stealth
games and anything gets caught I
understand
get on your idroid survived he's missing
have I been using codes in the gaming
Noack I've heard actually really amazing
things about destiny I've heard some
really good things there's no way I can
get into it I can't commit myself did I
type of game at the moment
ready blaze it 420 blaze life I just let
it go and it stops automatically maybe
you can stop it earlier that's actually
a good question hey guys can you stop
the cigar early I'd be very helpful
oh yeah that was a good close up face
shot of his horn yeah puff-puff pass me
there flipper that's right beefcake
apparently yeah you can oh if you
unequip it you can you can just stop
time whenever you want oh that's good to
know cuz yeah that happened to me the
other day was like I hit time and then
it got me to like 4:00 in the morning
and I only had a couple of hours to
before sunlight I was like oh come on
we sometimes Hellcat striker wants to
know if we ever use footage from the
livestream sometimes for some games we
do like to you know record ourselves
plays together we record the game
footage and record ourselves for this
game you know yeah we haven't just
because we knew it was the kind of the
type of game that you want to play alone
and you want to like really get into the
experience yeah that opening cutscene I
wish we would have played together and
filmed our reactions because I wish we
had me laughing at the game on camera
because of however that goes yeah and I
am recording some of my game I've
recorded a lot of the early gameplay
footage yeah and then just bits and
pieces here there I have my recorder
always set up yeah and if something
exciting happens I can just click record
and record chunks for the review and of
course we can use our our live streams
the live stream game footage isn't as
good a quality so if you ever see game
footage that's kind of like drastically
lower quality than than the other game
footage that's from the live chambers
all right now we're played for real
oh that's true captain I think the order
1886 had a bunch of live game stream
footage the Batman had some live stream
footage there's a lot of exactly how
they're sleeping people at night
yeah yeah you did people just can go to
sleep
ma'am er I don't I have not seen in the
new free version of light works sorry
cyberguy what I did go through this
section or maybe almost passed this by
the time I started screaming I forget no
no I went through this section I handled
it very differently than then Rich's
handle ouch I think just just different
there's no I'll just different
oh yeah that's right the Mario Kart
episode also had had footage from from
live streams of that yeah we use it all
the time I'll use any footage that I
think is entertaining and whether that
comes from just games what is it like
for example I'm probably going to use
the Box dropping on the horse footage
because that was a funny little moment
me calling rich a monster you know
that's funny so I will probably use that
you know what I'm gonna say I like this
a lot of differences at night with who's
where oh sure yeah after Charles moon
it's like before there were a hundred
guys on this bridge now there's like two
I was a flag Oh
ya know I like I like how patrols move
and I like how I like how they're slow I
like how like you know they they don't
walk in they they walk in patterns but
it's all very slow it'sit's a little
more realistic this isn't the first time
I've played it's the first time I played
the same section at night sure and then
a day though oh sure so I didn't know
there quite so many differences yeah but
like you know like what I'm saying is
like a guard will go to one end and just
hang out there for a couple minutes and
then go to the other and you know like
like a real Patrol
it isn't yep
that's just a great button mm-hmm oh
sure yeah and you can take advantage of
shift changes which i think is great
like again the part that I really like
about this game is the amount of
reconnaissance that you can do the slow
methodical military spy reconnaissance
oh I don't know that I found them by
accident rich are you aware that you
have night-vision goggles oh yeah okay
why am I using them I know there is a
battery life on them but you know you
could also you can I've found them
mostly to be unnecessary cuz you can
kind of see everything
like angle
taking the high road
oh they drove away tonight whoo that
Jeep
oh yeah well those all fucking around
then
fuck this waste of my fucking time hmm
great fucking great I'm looking to get
over to the G oh uh by the way I so I
got over significantly quicker than you
did as well and it's still left yeah how
did you go literally where you were
standing on that bridge when you first
got there you can just go right down
through the alley and there's not even
any guards down there yeah yeah I guess
during the day there's all those guards
looking down sure suicide right no I
didn't even walk right down there and
right to the stairway is it was really
easy so this is something I didn't
really know that this a huge amount of
difference in the garden placement at
night oh you like that huh I like that
yeah yeah
suicide rock climbing mission
she's in it you can't do it game says no
rich game says no that's a wall that's
that's just bullshit yeah I will or some
awesome person
oh I hate the I hate the open world it's
it's not an open world it's a lot of
invisible walls but well they're not
really invisible a lot of artificial
walls some invisible some invisible some
are officially yeah it's like this
fucking month uncrossable mountains
everywhere so you have to take these pre
dedicated set paths yep and I want an
actual open world I can cross as I
choose and every Road has that very
specific like quote unquote horse trail
that perfectly gets around every road
encampment yeah yeah it's a bit of faux
open-world but you know what I think
it's I think the levels are free-roam
enough that I'm ok with it you know it's
good for your base building
rich is playing this on PC
and I agree lakyn you don't necessarily
need the open world but they give the
illusion that there's an open world I'm
gonna say when I played Metal Gear Solid
the first times I didn't really know
exactly the crazy world I was getting
into sure the PlayStation 1 do things I
wanted run it again I wanted a nice
serious espionage story mmm is the idea
of infiltrating a base oh sure you know
but outside of that I also wanted
nonlinear way to progress to the base
that was really cool yeah and there's
nothing nonlinear about another gear
senator so yeah I'm in your thoughts
yeah about a bath
yeah yeah so I can I like and I don't
like the way this open world is designed
with the way you have to get through in
the obvious path hmm but I like cousin
well and the individual levels are open
yeah you can choose how you enter a
level gameplay-wise
I like everything about this a million
times more than the only other modern
Metal Gear I've played where's it at
this point is you know not really I will
admit to having zero idea how different
like like two or three are sure sure
you guys are sleeping - I played the
demo okay and I like demo but when I
read more about the story like yeah it's
even worse is even worse the story for
one what this melon gears the series I
wanted the like so bad but the story was
just so obnoxious
oh fuck oh my god so I don't know if you
know this right but if you want you can
have your your tranquilizer equipped
yeah then you gotta shoot him in the
head you could have shot him in the head
it would've been Simon they're gonna
motor strike your ass what I get for
going for the goodies yeah
he got sloppy you didn't do enough
reconnaissance you didn't notice that
there is an all other dude recently and
I like that I like that about the game
you know that's a good punishment for
not taking your time
Lord Belmont that's what I have I have
the Elgato Game Capture and it works it
works really well for some reason I'm
having a hard time streaming composite
devices but like that's what I used to
stream from the ps4 and from anything
HDMI I really like it we also have a
whole bulb I love to be able to take
like the high ground but nope can't go
here it's not on the design path
yeah it's but but it presents to you an
open world you know I I want to make
sure that like that's stressed because
it makes it seem as if it's an open
world and it's not
yeah and that's true sometimes in the
lockers you know there are cracks that
you can find that's true sometimes
yeah well and lured them out like
recording via HDMI and even recording
classic games with a composite cable
works great with my with my Elgato and
it's a really great little box it's it's
small very portable but for some reason
I can't get it the games to stream
through OBS if they come from a
composite cable let's you know if you
remember that's the issue we had with
our pokemon stream is we it just
wouldn't it wouldn't click over and I
don't know why but now streaming and
recording through HDMI works
fantastically and it's a lag list
capture I would love to find my own way
over there right you know what if those
the way I have to get there what if
there was like a like you could traverse
the mountains but that was extra
dangerous yeah but you get there a
little bit faster high ground for
surveying yeah that would be great rich
climbing equipment would be awesome yes
to be fair is there eventually climb
equipment is this a thing that can
happen know what you'll find every once
in a while is like a very obvious crack
in in a rock face and that is the area
in which you can play but it's not in
every Rock and it's only in very
specific areas and on some buildings too
that's how you can climb on some
buildings this game really really
I agree it looks great there's some
sometimes I get some weird object
detection in the game like especially
with my puppy I took my puppy on a
mission and I went inside a building and
the puppy wanted in and so his head was
just sticking right through the door you
know come on come on we're next-gen we
can object the thing you should have
used ours is yeah how would I rate
previously recorded its current brand
recognition thank you even out exactly
the same is where was when we first
started yep which I'm kind of okay with
kind of not okay with where we're
finding we're finding our way no one
worse reverse spinning in neutral we're
spinning in neutral what what we're
finding is the things we knew to be a
problem at the start are still a problem
which is it takes us a long time to play
a game and then it takes us a long time
to edit the review of that game rather
than like taking my time with Melchor I
feel like pressure medicine yeah so
we're we're at a bit of a rock and a
hard place
where in order to grow our brand
recognition we we need to do more big
games and get the reviews out soon but
we really like our in-depth folio
reviews and so that's just never ever
going to happen unless we can get three
releases which again it's just never
ever
y'see an alert I think this are many
boys that
you all are for that
even working I was doing a couple
minutes and I'll settle down
thanks too much smoking no and you know
I think like we've definitely become
more confident as streamers and
hopefully knock on all sorts of wood
we've figured out any of the weird
hardware software issues and so our
fidelity is now better
oh my god around that how do you say oh
you can't I intact yeah no I can't see
anything oh my god you made it oh maybe
we'll and that's true
ma'am rude like this dreams I think are
are coming into their own you know a
little more conversational a little more
more you know play it I think I got a
million times better in solo strips
yeah I'll just be a playing and talking
is this okay he's a weird thing and we
could do shorter like first review type
videos but there's a million of those
and I feel like there's not I feel like
there's no thing I wanted to do was in
depth yeah oh my god these missed those
first couple hate and a wife earlier
and I agree with her that I want
in-depth because one because I enjoy
that because one thing you don't see
much with games and it's true you don't
see that much with games which is why I
want to bring that unfortunately it
takes a lot of a long time to do in them
best feedback hasn't gotten the best
feedback and so then that's the trick is
like do we do it muscle forward
hello guy everything that's great snake
oh my god you have to go way back here
nothing feels worse than Justin Sacher
well that's that's that's the the catch
less sir goddess is it takes so long for
us to do the in-depth reviews that by
the time they come out it's no longer
relevant yeah but but that's the catch
because we get the game on release day
and we also have other jobs like if if
we're if rich and I didn't have jobs or
families or friends yeah we could get
these out fairly fast thinking like this
you don't want to barrel through as fast
as you possibly can right you know well
and if you barrel through you won't be
able to have the in-depth conversation
right so so that's the catch dad we do
dad we don't with the in-depth and so
for me I'm okay with with how we're
doing things I think on the Edit side I
am I'm trying to push my like rocket
League I got out and it was a five day
at it yeah and really it was a it was a
three day at it two other days I was
working on other stuff so it took me
three days after we shot that to edit it
and then two days I was working on other
stuff yeah well I got that turned around
in five days and I think that's a pretty
good turnaround yeah so that's what I'm
that's what I'm hoping to do in general
is it is a five-day turnaround
if I'm if we're really close like
already we're what a week into
Meadowview release so if rich and I
could shoot a review like early next
week I would probably try for like a
three day turnaround get it at the end
of next week they'd be really pushing it
down that'd be assuming I have no other
job yeah yeah yeah I mean we're already
pretty far off fear for sludge boy says
what if you came up with an angle for an
in-depth review like giving a game three
or four months to breathe and then doing
a hindsight review giving the audience
an entire narrative of the game's life
in the impact yeah interesting
yeah that's an interesting guy I still
think we would run into into the the
hype problem people don't care yeah
people are done hearing about you know
like if this metal gear review came out
five months after people don't want to
hear anything more right now everybody's
still talking about metal gear you know
everyone's uploading the gifts the mad
means everybody's mimin the shit out of
that if you like take it right
I mean just walk right down that Valley
and get there like a half of time all
right I mean there's probably some dudes
down here but but think about the
honeybee but it'll get you down there a
lot faster
I don't know who Jay Cutler is
quarterback to the Bears they're saying
it we would do better if we hired him
for what I don't know how interceptions
I don't understand
now you took my advice
you're way too far away actually this
might work look at all this ground
support is leaving oh except for that
guy's got a sniper there's your problem
good shot there you go now you might
have a chance so now go hide
what was that flare out the enemy's send
up a flare to help so you could so you
can just go down in that battle to the
right now you didn't even need to go as
far as I all looking that way they're
not looking this way oh sure I mean and
I think like I think you stopped them
from taking that guy which could be
incredibly helpful
but when I did it like I agree with that
I would like to do more like general
gameplay concepts videos not specific to
games but just general game
that's an alternator get their sneakers
grenade my wife oh my god
die hard motherfucker cuz if you're
gonna spy
you've got to spy hard Muslim you late
listen listen spy spoof not very good
but we're down to the themes on the card
Oh your right side what we got to do is
take a really shitty video game and put
it on a wheel of sometime
I think you're doing it right
oh you're not doing it stealth yeah but
I'd like I didn't get that guy
the time yes I can tell you about that I
can't
oh you can't get there's another set of
stairs on the other side you can likely
go right up there
yeah
do it
oh I think that was a shotgun specialist
yeah yeah come on how is every bullet
hitting that's tiny bar like I like my
bullshit yep yep
nice action movie splode it up don't
mind me just run rumors yeah ten asses
kicked
oh shit rich they're sending
reinforcements you got to wrap this up
you got to wrap this up man do you know
that you can change which shoulder you
look at when aiming you can go up you
all right
I know but you got to wrap this up
yep shutting up
yeah
don't let him man yes I didn't know you
could just throw them like that Arius
okay yeah Jesus Christ Ruth oh no and
the prison who died oh you kidding the
prisoner blew up with the truck rich
huge kind of really screwed the pooch on
this mission it's fine it's fine
so how much worse am i the jack oh my I
didn't die on this one really well not
until later not until much much later I
made it through that whole section I
think undetected no I don't consider
that I no no this is not the way the
entire game goes which was a little
which was a little haphazard with that
one I was I think we're gonna give it a
try now I wanted to I wanted to see if
you did I by the way if you would if you
would have killed everyone I think you
would have gotten that prisoner for you
no I I can't close that other sniper
yeah that fuck me I did not get that
prison it would really fucking was
picking up the wrong guy yeah I was
ready to grab him get my horse
a note the fuck out of there mm-hmm rich
went in guns blazing and that's true
gobbledygook gobbledygook says a great
point which is when I did the mission I
was not distracted by me
so rich is distracted by me did you get
you the drop did I forget to perfect
I'll tell them where to go
please select a drop point
don't drop it as requested I'll drop it
on course if I want to transfer down the
tourist man yeah where's your friend me
and he's your buddy
that's right baby I made it I made it I
got into any trouble
I was super sneaky don't do it me and
he's your buddy
he takes you places he goes he goes hey
friend why are you standing over there
friend that seems really weird I'm just
gonna eat some hay and think about my
wife and horse - halton you horrible
dickhead alright alright here we go
c-3po tato I should do another after
effects stream just to do more of those
effects I've been I've been negligent on
my space down fast I need to work on
them more so perhaps I will do another
stream just to make sure I work on
I've had work in metal gear come up so
I've been negligent on on my space back
effects oh whoa what what what are you
doing man I don't know what I'm doing
what are you doing man I don't know what
I'm doing I want to see you get to the
end of this mission
yeah I do too I want to see it's the
ends mission rich let's Karen never been
to dudes there perform can't and I
wasn't ready for it can we just take
five minutes and get your shit together
because I feel like you're not giving it
your all

[Part V]
goodnight Thanatos thanks for coming I
worked evening rocket League no I mean I
have been playing some actually and do
you know that you can crouch on your
horse it's weird that that would even
work hmm it's the same with the dog and
so after you but what ant what happened
was I was actually looking at the Chad
as I was riding across it stop looking
at the chat pay attention to this you
gotta get to the end of this mission
wrench yeah it's weird that they can't
see it it's like oh I guess a horse
would be passing by that's normal
why some guys leg you hanging off the
side of that horse I guess everything's
fine over here it's the same with your
puppy and your puppy by the way in in a
brilliant move of subtlety he's also
missing an eye and has an eyepatch when
he follows through on missions really
yeah lose an eye or he just sympathy I
frenched know it but your puppy is
losing an eye it was just a beat-up
puppy
yeah cuz he's a diamond dog rich just
like whatever yeah and your puppy is
just out there and the guards notice
them and they'd like to tell the shoe
like that's a weird there's a wolf with
an eyepatch over here
I hope someone doesn't stab me in the
belly
Octus Jack how do you keep yourself
motivated to edit edit I'm currently
editing a project and I'm always scared
to continue how do I get to the mood to
edit well right now if I don't edit I
can't eat or you know pay my mortgage so
that's a really good motivator but if
you're just doing it for fun or you know
like it's a side project or something
like that the thing that you need to
know is if you edit something you can
always change it later and that's what I
tell myself constantly is you know like
I don't feel like making any cuts
because it's like how what if it's not
the right one or you know I'm not really
feeling editing right now is you can
always go back and re-edit it later just
do some better that's all you need to do
is use that momentum
an object at rest tends to stay at rest
in an object in motion tends to stay in
motion and so all you need to do is
start moving and eventually it'll just
keep going and keep editing and and if
it sucks you just go back and you change
it later like when you are feeling in
the edit mood then you can take the work
you've already done and spruce it up but
just keep moving
that's my literally my only advice is
keep moving
yeah I don't think this is exactly this
is what I did first thing yeah it's just
wagons to go down here
also attacks motivational quote do
something that's it that's all you never
need know I'd never worked on avid or a
film splice oh I think I would be a
terrible editor if I had to work on a
film splice or worry you don't get that
many cuts nonlinear editing has been a
godsend where you can just fucking scrap
it I'll make a copy do something
different it's great great
you know like there's a lot of busy work
with editing to that that I do if I'm
not necessarily in the mood you know
labeling clips just watching it and
making markers knowing where all the
good stuff is
oh nice rich I didn't go this way that
looks like a great way to go oh do
so that's that's what I do you know and
then you get into a flow like oh this is
you know you said it's at a time like
okay this time during the day is my edit
time I know I'm gonna edit and you just
sit in front of your computer and edit
everybody has not worked almost worked I
think they take him away in that car so
there might be a way you can stop the
car up the road but I don't know if you
can do that without oh you know what you
can probably do is if you go to the road
you could just murder the driver - wait
- the farther away from everything
you're good enough shot
oh the people in the Jeep see you
Oh
oh don't worry them to stop for you oh
my god
quick get him getting Oh
like I just give up Jack well so here
here's what I'll tell you yeah is they
take that prisoner to the next area of
the lung huh and there's a way to get
them at the next area well I didn't I
because I I move too slowly to the next
area
yeah so you don't have to get it as I
guess what I'm saying yeah all right so
you know if he dies there he just dies
there I guess but or you could try to
get to the next the next area and go
quicker through that or just move
forward
I can only imagine riches playing
slightly more haphazard than he normally
would because of this dream or at least
that's what he's gonna tell us all ho by
the way spike 13 and 2 that's that was a
really cool thing about the Apple TV so
I'm going back to Apple yeah
so they announced the new Apple TV which
has this fancy controller which has a
touch area with it much like an iPhone
it's not a screen it's just a touch area
and it has a Syrian or some little cool
software features but one of the neatest
things is is they're they're opening of
an app store just for Apple TV and
they're they're opening up to games a
lot and so you use the the little swipe
remote as a gaming controller but it can
also be a multiplayer game gaming
console if anyone else has an iPhone or
an iPad they can play a game with you
just by using their iPhone as a swipey
which i think is really neat and so they
were giving examples of like a four
player game where one person had the
regular remote and three other people
just had an iPhone yeah like oh that's
really cool
beyond the eye yeah right but it'll also
you know do practical stuff
you know they were they were showing up
it's a new life search integration with
Siri and so you know they'll search
through all passions through Netflix
through through Hulu through iTunes
store everything and so you know the
lady was like oh I feel like watching an
action movie
how about how bout a James Bond movie
and so then it narrowed it down to you
know action games Bond movies oh just
the one starring Sean Connery boom you
know like that kind of smart search
contexts and sensitive search I thought
was really neat I guess what I'm saying
is I'm gonna want to buy an ITV
any multi I know you just want to stuff
up here
I see I don't even use binoculars oh
it's oh that's right you don't have the
stats binoculars that's true Apple
making it for $1,000 then Samsung will
do the same for $40 next year that's
true there's a you know Apple's a
special thing
how do you throw people gosh
right I'm Rachel right shoulder button
just throws them I fucking love that
so you guys are you trying to like get
further down in the road and take those
guys down
good
you know you could put them down gently
a politically worse than their
competitors apples special give the
thing that makes Apple special is far
and you know I'm incredibly biased I'm a
huge Apple and and I understand that but
the thing that that I think makes them
special is that they make both the
hardware and the software and so
computer people some computer people
would say that you know that that makes
their machines run a little smoother it
might it may or may not but because
they're because they are in charge of
the software side and the hardware side
that's what makes them special in my
book
the tourism yeah that was buttery smooth
stuff right there it's buttery I don't
know if this place that would work for
this game but I my third method would be
ghosting nobody sees you at all oh sure
don't know big name bother knocking into
the out you know nobody ever knows you
were there
oh sorry they don't make the harder they
design harder of course people in China
make up hey they design I don't know
anymore special well but theoretically
and you know this is this is just me
being a fanboy if you design all the ins
and outs and the software that runs the
ins and outs would theoretically be more
efficient
theoretically oh ya know and Apple over
charges for their products everyone
knows that but at least for the Apple
products I've purchased I've gotten an
incredible lifespan out of them so I
think it's worth it it's about fun maybe
it's a zombie horde oh I have you ever
seen your horse get picked up when you
get in the helicopter yeah your horse
gets Fulton down so maybe a foot it may
be a Fulton drops in I think the Fulton
drop
it's very silly even though I don't care
if it's some real thing it's very silly
it's a ghost tours that's actually gonna
be the twist at the end of the game is
your horse was dead the whole time I
could see that someone's gonna you know
your horse or your puppy or quiet is
gonna die or all of them someone someone
is someone who you're friends with is
gonna die at the end of the game right
that's gonna happen well this is a
prequel so we know what's gonna happen I
don't know what's gonna happen I haven't
paid attention in of the games I know I
know a big boss has to go on to develop
mother base and get metal gear back okay
it's preordained normally normally when
you do a prequel when you know what's
gonna happen in the characters you at
least fill in important back like this
is how they came to be mm-hmm but they
already had that with big boss in Metal
Gear 3 so this is just kind of
masturbation
yeah is there that thing you know he did
no no that happened inside really don't
hit that
the twist is that the horse is Big Boss
I like it
those guys are silly with their big-ass
radio backpacks yeah I love them I love
them something if I take them out they
won't be able to college back up how
that works well there are there are
radio did you do there's a side mission
where you like take out radio networks
and then each base has like a group of
three satellite dishes on it and if you
explode them they can't call for
reinforcements there there are things
you can do with one mission satellite
dishes yeah that might be oh yeah I know
and I know that this is 1984 so
everything is big and ridiculous that's
what I'm saying that's why I like it I
think it's funny but also you know you
have your holographic the I'd ride
Jack: But, anyway...
Rich: I...hate this thing, that would work...
Jack: Are you just gonna try to walk right past him like that? Is it gonna work?
Rich: We'll see. I could regret this.
Jack: Oh, get down! Get, what are you doing?
Rich: I went to hit X, to gallop...
Jack: Don't gallop! 
Rich: ...when he got off.
Jack: Just, hey. Casual, casual.
Rich: Just a casual horse. Casual horse! Casual horse! Don't mind me. 
Jack: I think they noticed you. Can you get on the other side now? Are they--
Rich: Casual horse! 
Jack: Wait, are they coming back for you?
Rich: Nope!
Jack: They're going away?! Fuck you, that worked...
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: Just, just a casual horse going for a casual midnight stroll. Don't even worry about me, man!
Rich: How about that stealth?
Jack: Whoo! That AI, Rich.
Rich: Gotta love it. 
Jack: That AI is something special, right there.
if the horse could nonchalantly whistle
I'm sure it would
is there a nonchalant whistle button
great you know what I want that in a
self dude I'm officially I'm officially
stating this for anyone out there who
hears this I hated doing that but it
worked it worked it works great and I
feel bad that it worked
whoever designed a stealth game I want a
nonchalant whistle button that gives you
stealth points oh my god you just made
it past that base that was very lucky
that you just walked right past that you
didn't even know it was it I walked
around that anymore oh oh you knew that
was there okay
when I got up this Hill I didn't realize
it was so close artic is Rex says just
tune in our Jack and rich enjoying Metal
Gear Solid 5 Jack most certainly not
well I'm a bit more on the fence the I
believe the general consensus between us
is that the missions like what rich is
right here this is fun even though I'm
sucking the missions are very fun and
satisfying and there are parts of the
games that rich and I do not like Jack
does not like them more than rich yeah
bud I'm just ignoring those aspects of
the game so far but like what's
happening right the story we really like
we really like the missions
yeah you can get the horse armor the
horse gets armor I just got the upgrade
where I you can you can this is
something you can actually be in the
game right you can give your puppy a
knife you can give your puppy a knife
and tell them to go attack guards it's a
little they'll probably they'll probably
you know check it out they'll probably
investigate plays the games rich and I
are planning on doing metal design for
the next base well they just went on
alert status is what it said everyone
that's what is it so now what you need
to do is wait until they investigate and
give the all-clear wait wait we heard
gunfire weird the gunfire I know why
you're doing the smart thing really and
you doing it no how much do they pay you
they don't pay me enough vodka Oh fuckin
bed they give me they give me a room
maybe something called a ruble
you got that you gotta repo I got paid
in blankets I have eight two blankets
they just ran away yeah they just ran
away
now they're running back I think they
had a discuss I think they they ran away
to muster up their courage you can do
this
Dimitri I believe in you you should draw
nice nice rich it's fuckin and shut
now stick a knife in their throat
like why why bother hiding them they're
just gonna wake up when I can do this oh
yeah there you go
boom not a part of your team oh and by
the way let's be on the game every time
why do they scream when they're passed
out isn't that the whole thing is you
have to get them passed out so they
don't struggle
I'm moving them over here to protocol
numbers because we're in a cave
yeah and I don't think I can fold them
and it gives you the percentage points
look up I don't care this vibe oh sure
this is easy way to hide the bodies
subject leave the rest to us
oh okay it does cost GMP
yeah the animal screams - you're like
when you have you volton to animals yeah
yeah it's all very silly yeah that's why
I thought is this actually a full-blown
comedy right but apparently that's a
real question I had a legitimate
question that's right i Fulton the bear
on Sunday I found a bear fuckin it took
like 20 shots of the tranquilizer link
to get him down like right in the head
yep I got him though my fucking guy took
I think I died a couple times what are
you getting for fucking animals you get
money you just get my eye there's a like
a lion where they say like a
conservation group wants to save them
from the what do you get for a barrel I
think I got a decent amount of money I
don't remember it doesn't matter it's
just it's fun
how are some of these guys marked
alright while those guys are from their
mothers probably gg again like I said
you meet survivor I'm guessing the
Soviets are making him take them to the
honey bee all right following and I like
like I said earlier I did not get to him
in time but obviously you don't have to
eventually a zoo platform is built that
you can go and visit and see all the
animals who stole what it's really it's
so ridiculous it's not ridiculous make
up your mind
I talk about how much I tend to hate the
story of Metal Gear yeah oh and
apparently like getting more animals
means to get more money and more hero
points okay and that helps attract
soldiers to your base for the soldier
building minigame
where are you going you guys make up
your fucking mind
oh my god oh my god over it - you're
about to get lucky as a motherfucker
sandstone
but sandstorms made of one's life well
not totally blind
and you're gonna break you later
sandstorm dudududududududu today today
today today today today today today
today there's a song called sandstorm
and it goes like that did it into dude
dude dude yeah I do remember that you're
gonna run them like right into something
right yeah
the portable toilet they're gonna hide
inside watch the enemy doesn't decide to
use it same goes for hiding down enemies
in it okay
okay I'll take that yep you know that is
it's a poster you can collect them yeah
you get money enough someone something
you can like like make boxes with them
later or something and yourself just
don't stand too close to me afterward no
you know that big bows Miller
whatever his name is
sure right you got the Sun coming up
you know what I never did to end up
seeing Jurassic world rich did you ever
end up saying drastic route yeah never
came up I did some quick base management
why
I'm swimming that so if we check out the
Porta Potty and you're in there this
will keep them from checking the Porta
Potty
but that's only playing in your earpiece
I only assume that's why this is here
I guess that makes sense but you know
excitation hey I don't know why don't we
haven't gotten there yet oh you you have
to unlock the speaker function but yes
that works so for that part you were
just playing that in your ear oh yeah
but eventually you get a speaker
function and yes that will work slit his
throat split his fucking throat rich he
gave you information he's a worthless
come on people to give you information
throats yeah no one's gonna ever give
you information no no one else the time
I find this guy he's gonna spill his
guts cuz he knows I leave my wife
but it's to be able to catch that guy
he's up the tail they're taking him
someone Oh or is he still in the front
steps
he's somewhere else
fuck he's radioing but you gotta catch
him before the radios let us throw it as
quickly slit his fucking throat he's the
enemy rich fucking spill his blood paint
down your face I am a monster I kill
everyone I kill everyone I give me
information I kill fucking everyone
because that's yeah Mike come on cluster
guys little popgun
I'm liking this mission they're not
letting you get the groover I love this
game
we also have iron sights on
oh my god
the fuck did you get spotted by
but that's that's true
oh shit see if he can Fulton that
prisoner in there oh my god so many
soldiers no no he wasn't a place of a
hundred percent but you moved him to a
place of zero percent so now I'm moving
like slightly more into the open
yeah that's good enough 90 you do that
sound
get out of here get out of town he's a
mute
it's it's inside
did I change guns Oh oh yeah if you if
you hold down circle you you take the
gun on the ground so you got to find
your guy can yeah okay good I do that
all the time like if I'm trying to pick
up a guy I'll pick up their gun instead
yeah oh wait now also reload
so do you see how you ready chose white
it's not in your that means it's not in
your effective range it needs to be read
locate great range thing there's a range
that makes sense
how's the chat feeling about me no I
think now they're talking about other
stuff oh now that I'm not sucking not
only and better things
salesman yes that that is a that's a
factual error hitting someone in the
head should not affect them faster than
hitting them anywhere else if anything
you should have to make like a heart
shot or something you know I think the
head shot is just for you it's probably
a lethal dose in their head which is why
it knocks them out so it's a gameplay
thing is more of a challenge so legs are
not embarrassing yes
shutting up nothing it's great I think I
think if you well then this is a fun
this is a business fun you know you know
why it's a fun big map it's a nice big
map and I really like that about this
one and for the first time in the game I
want to say there's a varied environment
you know where it's like we're a little
outside we're a little inside there's a
cave I didn't yep everything's fine
that's right I kill commies during
during my run I killed everyone
like I would interrogate them and just
murder everyone yeah so far you you're
not a murderer you you leave them alive
you leave the challenge you well you
know I caught them sneak away and then I
would slit their throat yeah after I got
their information beat wallet cuz here's
the thing they're gonna go on and give
like possibly a description of you maybe
say what you were wearing sure if they
know what I look like y'all come this
way
I'm leaving no witnesses I'm being moral
selfie yeah you are being more humane
and that's what gets you killed rich in
the real world that's what gets you
killed
I usually like when I play the game I'd
take time to dump the dead bodies like
in in the woods or whatnot but now you
know as concerns speak I wanted to get
this thing you know I think killing
value man is better than leaving them
alive I don't want anyone to give in a
description of me in my stealth attune
what happened Oh cutscene I was all set
to jump in the Jeep and drive away I was
all I could I'm gonna use that Jeep I
know what I'm doing okay
and what a cutscene it is rich
little girls there yeah
and so things
I'm sometimes a descriptor I was
enjoying this before the supernatural
should happen I know I was really into
what I was doing I mean I was loving it
and now this me too and by the way that
was exactly my same reaction on Sunday
which was just dead silence gone what
yeah it was a really fun mission right
oh yeah sneaking all the way up to the
bays getting in there what if forward to
getting out of the base I really was
they're all going in to investigate the
body yeah no it's a good plan no you
look well-rested big boss that is the
dumbest thing how you've changed you bi
no that's not the dumbest thing yeah
you're about to see the dumbest thing
rich
well I'm sure you'll see the bigger
picture eventually there's the dumbest
thing the the bad guys wearing a Lone
Ranger that's what
why if you get out of here he's not
hiding anything
what is your face he's hiding his
identity rich this time
you inhale story it's a walking robot
that cost 100 trillion dollars we'll
take it down with this tank it's got
many weak points of the joints and it
can topple over and break easily and it
costs a lot of manpower a lot of
manpower and money to build we could
have had like like 20 jets like 20 jets
eat any one of them that's much faster
and more efficient any one of the Jets
could take down this easily
why doesn't the mist possess you
the skulls what's he doing to that
soldier
go other way that's you're going to
example I did I ran away other people in
the chat we're saying that they were
able to fight them off you could use the
rocket launcher to fight them off but I
just fucking ran away once you got here
I got my mojo oh yeah
I I was waiting on that because I could
tell how much you were really enjoying
that Metal Gear just stop it you're fun
when you're not Metal Gear you don't
really know how to tell a story you just
you don't think you do I think here's
here's my my thought is I think Kojima
has a lot of fun ideas you know big
metal man the demand the mask the the
spinous like I think he has a lot of fun
ideas that he doesn't necessarily know
how to put
you know
yeah yeah really turn up and now
there'll be a path on your right
yeah
I should be able to get there all right
yeah that's right dong Ali Kojima will
absolutely be the next to start a
Kickstarter oh yeah for the spiritual
successor to Metal Gear and it will go
nuts H it just like every other one
pick up
okay
they have one flawed run early spring
back
I thought I was gonna have to blow it
away oh yeah Hellcats preggers you two
have a nice lose and thanks for coming
by
it's been fun when it kicks itself in
the balls yeah that sneaking was a lot
of fun wasn't yeah it was it was a great
little sneaky section up until the Miss
zombies but the missed zombies well I
think you know that I was talking about
earlier about like comparing it to like
the tone of like something like
blood-borne where Rick resergy is is
chiding us for our cynicism your
cynicism I'm Metal Gear it's just not
that's not what they've come to expect
with us Ross why am i wrong to not like
the nonsense why am i wrong well this is
what I'm saying
what if the entire if the gameplay we
structured around the nonsense I think
it could be a lot of fun it's it's not
the nonsense and this is me just
speaking for me it's nothin um since I
don't like it's the nonsense paired with
the very serious stripped-down spy
gameplay nonsense cutscenes slow
methodical they can't you engrossed with
this serious technical military stuff
yeah and then they pull the rug right
from out from under you with and then
elaborate cutscenes and and guys
floating around with a gas mask and
skeleton men with masks on for some
reason yeah yeah
yeah you're not wrong to not like you're
also you're just also not right either
it's a preference then yeah I'm we're
talking about our preference deal with
it this is I didn't say no point did I
ever say that you shouldn't like these
things at no point did I say that I've
understood for years then people love
this it's just it's not for me right I'm
not gonna pretend it is for me oh all
we've been trying to do is articulate
our thoughts and feelings which is is
what was purposeful point we don't we
didn't we didn't start a gaming thing so
we can tell you how you feel about
something you know how you feel about it
okay okay we're done let's do the thing
let's thank our wonderful subscribers
wait yeah you might have a cutscene no
no we don't there's no ill-will but
after that I most definitely
nope no we can't risk is in the testes
in the task manager now you check how
often you see me skip cutscenes ma ones
I've never even seen before
