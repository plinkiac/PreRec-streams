[Part I]
how the hell are you guys in here right
now
I didn't tweet anything else out I just
all I did was change the name of the
room of the stream or whatever oh my god
that's unbelievable
hello hello yes there is a secret stream
I feel like attempting a know a death
run on Dead Rising
yet again trying this yet again and make
sure this yeah yeah we're streaming out
this is live this is live this is going
to be a fairly quiet stream because this
is going to be a dead identity PUD very
funny a dead serious attempt at a true
ending which is the you know the harder
ending to get no death run of dead
rising to starting from scratch while
saving as many people as I possibly can
so yeah I'm gonna start I'm maybe not
gonna talk that much this son but I mean
you know watch your dumb chat amongst
yourselves whatever
right
last time I died at the second Carlito
fight I don't know
Anna how familiar either of you guys are
with the game the two people here right
now uh for for history's sake cooks
psychosis and space vagrant but I died
on the second carlito fight which is fun
he attacks you with a sniper rifle and
it's difficult because you know I'm
starting from scratch didn't have much
of a mystery I smell I've rethought my
strategy this time I'm going to bring
quick steps I'm gonna be got a tip
making a lot more a quick step in
general quick step is one of the big
strengths you can make energy wonders
that makes you move a lot faster
freelance pal wasn't waiting for the TV
to tell me what to cover
here she is my license tempus is alright
Colorado populace alright I managed to
save everyone I possibly could but wait
up wait way too much time the only thing
to do in this town is kill time at the
shopping mall what I love about this
game is how how stringent the time
limits are if if you don't want to save
as many people as you can
yeah looks like taking the helicopter
was the way to go you're willing to let
people die all the roads blocked off by
now
you can save more people all right
listen
he has nothing has shots of the whole
town before the National Guard finishes
roping it off if she don't take me over
the Main Street just for my own sake you
guys might be here in double audio but
I'm hearing sound that up delay so I'm
turning up the TV volume a bit which is
probably gonna pick up on this this
microphone I'm using sorry about that
but I need to hear what's going on this
is serious business
and I'm going to have to adjust chem
controls
and did that after this helicopter dead
I'm not I'm not skipping this because i
can i can earn a lot of free points just
from these photos you know me i don't
ever skip cutscenes anyway
well you hearing are you hearing an echo
in the game right now because I just
turned the okay good I'm kind of shocked
this mic isn't picking it up this is a
pretty good mic
this is what you can to take pictures
more comfortable I don't need the stupid
headphones at all
Hopa some what I'm doing take take good
pictures take better pictures as you can
you get more points taking pictures when
the action happens
boy everybody just walking in
how am i doing I'm doing great
I have no idea one thing for sure
whatever is going on down there it's not
business
lobster gun thank you for subscribing we
really appreciate it
it's true we do
I would build the faggot spike if a
spiked bat if this were dead rising
through this is Dead Rising 1 so I do
not have that option that Dead Rising 2
was the cookie one with them with the
combo weapons this is the one with a
stringent time limit since more
difficult yet more satisfied
sure the one knows but now but I am a
bigger fan of dead rising not one
good
person asking in the chat the first try
I got to the the second card legal fight
which I have I have other strategies in
mind
this is yeah this was a xbox 360
exclusive so the PlayStation this is on
PlayStation nothing
yeah no I know I missed the explosion
last time that really fucking pissed me
off though I could have been centered
better on the explosion but is where it
is
I was not taking a picture which does a
gun Adam
they invested my knowledge this game has
never been released on anything but the
xbox360 and if there's a secret
PlayStation release just just out of
curiosity let me know about it
curious
I'm 1 1 1 1 I want to see battery of
town take me there
I'm glad you enjoyed Karin during the
last street lesser God I'm glad you
enjoyed her she enjoyed doing the stream
I'm sure she'll be she'll be around from
time to time
oh god yeah
lobster cut I remember the weed release
hey shop co-driver me on the rooftop but
they should have called that game Dead
Rising for zombie choose me man you are
nuts
all right listen up don't forget to come
back for me as long as you're not dead
Fred its Frank Frank West remembers I
ain't 92 in three days thank you for
subscribing
we really appreciate six-month whoa
just bite down to that rooftop
shootout for this one
we're going down perfect dark thank you
for ceramic we really appreciate three
months in a row
hello there you're the reporter aren't
you yeah you came along
yeah I'm freelance you know that's you
know only does I know but people are
starting to pour in now this might be so
stream might be white on me talker
Inglis this is a this is a serious you
know dick run attempt that I just
figured I'd stream for back of it why
not you see from this why not you gotta
do it anyway
wine extremely well if it were just a
riot I doubt the military would
quarantine the entire area the
moratorium on information getting out is
a little extreme see Lucas I know you
check randomly but we just uh we I just
start can't put my finger on Zoe and
wind when I die so we'll see how long
this lasts
doesn't sound like civil disobedience
it's - yeah justjust just heads up the
stream ends when I die almost as if
everyone's already dead
yeah
so why don't you just tell me already
what's going on
I think you'd better see for yourself
yes I am going for the the the the good
ending the perfectly the true ending
whatever you want Colin and I'm also
going to try and save as many people as
possible one because I'm a hero goddamn
it and secondly so I can level up too
but mostly because I'm a hero god damn
it I like saving people in games yeah if
you feel like you're showing up late if
I if I skip the intro cutscene stuff
basically the game would just be
starting right now right here anyway yes
frequence plead actually you take
pictures of like boobies and whatnot
held it nosebleeds it's silly they don't
so kind of like a Japanese thing I think
ha nosebleeds equal equal lust or
something that were there weird like
that
what in the world
how long would I know less how long they
know deathrun last pretty a fairly long
time I think it's longer than I thought
I don't remember if basically have to
survive for three in-game days and then
if you get the good in and that's a
little bit longer yet spoilers and I
don't remember if a day is too real
hours or three-rail hours so we could be
here a while you're not you're not
obligated to say I mean you could you
could just leave and come back or just
leave oh that's fine I understand
there's no guarantee I'll make it
through the whole fucking thing anyway
I'll probably fuck up at some point
hey bring that over here
around
sweetie donkey Oh where's my Madonna
I will not be using the Mega Buster
because I specifically want to start low
one so this is not using any kind of
previous save this game thinks it's
especially rush late I didn't want to
last time because it was so quickly
sheep but I'm gonna do it this time I am
probably going to abuse the mini
chainsaws I hate saying that but at
least for the boss sites fights and I'm
gonna use those button incest now and
I'm gonna feel dirty when I do it look
on the bright side
zombie says dirty stupid and slow we
should be safe in here
alright then be like making yourself
useful take a look around the mall bring
anything we can use for the barricade
back here on doing Oh
pronto I know I know the mini chainsaws
are legit there than that actually
they're not actually cheating but it
feels like it it feels like it those
things are so imbalanced alone that's so
weird no right now I got a divert myself
and every game I play I got to tell the
Xbox that
fantastic
not bad not bad all right last time I I
know I I took pictures of all the
survivors cuz I thought maybe cuz I
don't care about achievements but I
figured maybe along with the achievement
I would get prestige points to level up
and it doesn't look like I did so I'm
probably not gonna bother this time
you stop right there
do you have any idea what you've done
why did you summon me to this place what
are you planning what something
something I don't even know if I'm gonna
buy because huh everything was fine and
now my end
this way this is where I fucked up and
died
going for the chakra
what in the hell are you people doing
quick move get over here
everyone move this way quick to the
stairs
all about
by their turn tutorials often
Alister o98 fucking waste fucking waste
of a picture
bad
the bandpass horse no I know I can get
pictures in the 1000 the Jews Abby's
food our water oh I got the shotgun
hold on hold on get out at one time
that's more like it either butter
that's okay okay good good fantastic
you can attack zombies just with this
but when you're not level then that
isn't very effective near the end of the
game
barehanded if you can be kind of beastly
right now I am NOT you kind of need a
weapon
early on it again fantastic
fantastic
well
and what I'm doing here is I can get
some decent pictures in this first
section and I'm trying to level my Frank
up and my strategy is to level up
quickly as I can the higher my level the
easier the later sections of the game
get
then past
and
fantastic
you would front down it from other side
they say I am going for a near perfect
run I don't think I'm gonna save
everybody
fantastic
fasting
we'll be done farming in a second one
more one more
huh
is there a limited amount of time I look
at my favor can you just keep taking
pics so the score bottoms out no uh I
don't know you uh you only have like I
hope they got three shots in your camera
before you need to find batteries for
your camera
as long as those things are in the mall
we'd better not use this door what are
you doing hey yeah I know I know I was
farming there but we're working towards
a goal here everybody we need to do this
and apparently those things I need your
inspiration and help if this is going to
succeed be a factor wait a minute you
want to get back in there what for hey
hey
nice camera are you a photographer as a
matter of fact I am Frank West
photojournalist could you show me some
pictures frame
you really seem to know what you're
doing who are you guys anyway and what
are you I took that one near the
entrance that guy do something
nope thanks for showing me though
hey we're not done talking yet just who
are you guys
I'm Jesse the man you saw earlier is
Brad that's all I'm authorized to tell
you
right
after listened oh just actually I need
to go back to that room I need to grab
some coffee creamer
because it's part of my my revamp
strategy
coffee creamer which is clearly
chocolate milk
I really need some inventory slot
upgrades here don't I
Hey anybody around no nobody's around
talk to me Jeff let's get this over with
don't don't run from me I'm here to help
all right
get you and your wife back to the
security room on our way mister
fantastic
come on
yeah
come on over there
hurry up Natalie
Oh get out away any shot of that vent
fantastic
alright I'd rather desperately need
inventory space there's other upgrades
er no I did get one oh good it's got it
yes alright don't give map before I
forget save that one for later
will be necessary
shut up Louis Yuda let you finish
talking for the next cutscene trigger so
I don't have to take that call against a
shop finish
zombies huh had a feeling you'd show up
Oh God it's you look don't sneak up on
me
Brad was attacked I located him on the
monitor oh it's probably just a sprain
I've gotta help Brad or he's done for
all right fine give me your gun come on
I'm the reason you just got hurt let me
help
no I can't let a civilian do that that's
against regulations yeah well I don't
think they had zombie infested malls in
mind when they wrote those regulations
kid you know how to use this kinda I've
covered wars you know
look after I'm through helping you you
and I are gonna have a nice little chat
all right now
last time I'm saying this from the
stream first started but not everyone
was here then last time I didn't know
death run I died on the second Carlito
fights well he's a sniper rifle Adam I
had trouble getting close without
getting shot
so my revised strategy is to make some
quick step which makes you temporarily
run faster which is why I needed that
coffee creamer
it's coffee creamer which is Java milk
and orange juice makes fix them
and I figure this might come in handy
other places too so I'm not just
grabbing it for the section for that one
fight I mean
I presume the skateboards faster
oldest you can tell me later
yeah a no dinner this wouldn't be easy
if I just like stayed in the security
room for seven everything but I have
ended up doing that work we're going for
the good ending hmm Jesse and his mini
Peter saved as I can okay we'll have to
talk about this later you know how to
use that gun I've never fired at a
person
all right I'll cover you from here you
need to stick to the shadows try to get
close to the target okay and what am I
supposed to do when I get close well the
best solution would be to shoot the guy
but if you can't do that keep them busy
dodging your bullets and stay out of
trouble
are you up to it I'm a lot better with a
camera but yeah I'll give it a shot
all right
next time you reloads I'll lay down a
suppressing fire I'm counting on you
make your way over there one two three
this I hate me I hate you of us everyone
hates you die
you I hate all this hate everybody in
this game doesn't even Frank West or
Isabella
this fight sucks
I'm on a clock here Carlito
I got a lot to do before sunset I can't
fuck around with you all day
he got away you notice how Carlito runs
out of cover to load his gun no well
thanks for your help the name's Brad
I'm Frank West photojournalist and right
now I'd rather have an explanation than
your thanks Brad sorry
I've got nothing to tell you
look
I don't know what Jesse told you but as
far as I'm concerned we're through
working together so you cover your
zombie story and leave the rest to us
you uh you guys are looking for someone
here aren't ya
who is that where did you help me I help
you
damn you one hell of a journalist aren't
you Frank a hot-headed underhanded
hotshot paparazzi with nothing better to
do than to invade people's privacy I try
you got a point
you win Frank
let's work together
Jesse and I are DHS agents and yes we
are looking for the man in that picture
you're with Homeland Security is that
guy a terrorist or something
and took that picture in the entrance
Plaza right near the front door
the entrance Plaza you're sure
hey so do I have your permission to
cover this story or not
Ratna wish run through these guys you
know you know better
Oh
just get the little swish alright that
kind of way
something I should play the new Dead
Rising 3 I've heard nothing but bad
things and it looks boring and it
doesn't have Frank West Chuck Greenwood
shows up again and home well I love
Chuck rain Chuck green was the main
character Dead Rising 2
he's the boring sir he's that bad I
don't just kind of he come with us we
can rap he's just kind of boring care
I'm not believing this character is
summed up then he hasn't it's gotta save
his daughter Frank is interesting cuz
he's just kind of a sleazy paparazzi and
he gets in over his head
well what happened you can't just arrest
him he turned down my offer to protect
him said he isn't going anywhere until I
can guarantee a secure route out of here
oh I know I know all about Dead Rising 2
AMA
rescue it starring frequent you didn't
raise the coop record as the Dead Rising
2 uh like kind of like director Scott
only they switched out the main
character it's this guy in off the
record I know I have it
but right now I'm bound and determined
to do it no death row enough for
beginning on dead rising nom 1
I'm sure I will stream off-the-record at
some point not right now though
what happens if I fill then I'll try
again at some point I I think I've done
it before I don't know if I've done it
before starting from loving one though
there we go that's what I want
yeah
what if I'm never able to do it I am
confident that I am able to do this back
back in the day I knew this game like
the back of my hand I'm not saying I'm
not saying I'm back there yet I'm not
saying I'm gonna succeed tonight but I
know I can do it I know I know in my
heart I can do it
all right time signal somebody help me

Aaron didn't manage to get himself
killed
that's fuckin great
damn
technically the world isn't coming to an
end in a zombie apocalypse the these
zombies at least in this game are

hmm so that's what dr. Barnaby said huh
the old coots not dumb he wants us to
call for help first so we got a line out
or what
the signals being blocked
I can't even contact HQ on the emergency
line so if we want to get our hands on
dr. Barnaby we're gonna have to secure a
way out of here ourselves all right
we've got to deal with the situation
we've been handed the boneheads back at
HQ might be working on something too
there's a helicopter coming three days
from now at noon it's my ride is you're
right reliable absolutely that's how I
plan on getting out of here all right
then I'll see to it that the DHS picks
up the Charter speech

long as you tell me what's going on okay
I'll tell you what you want to know
later we have more pressing business
right now if we have to wait here for
three days we'll need supplies water
blankets on the light we'll get dr. Barr
to be here tomorrow morning I want you
to keep an eye on the monitors
yeah
stock up all right good good
so you guys talking about Resident Evil
and the chap dead dead rising is my
zombie game of chess
Oh
rich rich is playing which is the only
one here
yeah here we go
yeah
follow me oh wait Oh
is this a secret bonus stream I felt
like doing a rising Doge death run again
so I figured why not why not stream it
come on so everybody going he done wait
over there
follow me
I understand fantastic I'm taking this
picture for the Kent storyline you need
AE rakla
picture of at least 750 points which got
right there that's taken care of
don't worry about that
fuck
drop that shot girls like that
I think I'm doing pretty good on time
I'm doing something a lot different than
I usually do I usually save bill Aaron
well consider guys Berks Sophie and lay
all of us and the convicts kitty cause
the convicts that huge group is always a
pain in the ass so doing something a
little bit different this time and I
think it's working out I think I'm doing
just as good on time as I normally would
to just because it's very hard to get
done through the park
what all skills do I have unlocked right
now dodge kicked alright alright alright
right to the door I need to close
oh we run out right then
Janice
Wow
what system has the most number of bad
games and be the Atari 2600 damn near
all of them
and this is why I brought food
I got away I need to get out of here
oh you're welcome for the surprise
stream I just hope you don't mind that
I'm not talking that much because I'm
all business all business
Oh
it's a little slow of course the clock
though all right we can do this
have waited for the shark to throw from
the crisis wait
cyber bitch
I'm gonna kill you first
they killed my favorite survivor damn
them
there's no way I'm gonna have enough
people for the saint chief like I'm
really going for achievements but I do
walk save even feel it back there that's
not gonna happen that because of the
convicts but I'm probably not gonna be
afraid to sacrifice some other people
now if I absolutely have to I guess I
guess that's a good thing
all right well I'm sad that I lost Leigh
she is my favorite because even though
she's purple typically if you just set
her down on her own and go to do
something else she's she's fully capable
of holding her own she'll she can handle
the group of zombies that late yeah
but right now I got a are myself for I
Adam I'm grabbing one heavy hit weapon
this year's sledgehammer and then I'm
gonna make sure I grab maybe the frying
pan something that I can swing a bit
kicker a quick kicker quicker fucking
lost late god dammit god dammit I feel
so bad she lost her baby her sweet baby
and now she's dead
oh I'm gonna get those convicts we're
gonna avenge late that's not gonna be
run away I'm still on the weak side of
things doesn't this game have a time
limit or some bullshit this game
definitely has a time limit and it's not
bullshit it's what makes this game great
look the way the game set up if you
don't care about the story if you just
want to have fun killing zombies you can
ignore any any kind of story base time
run whatever and just have fun but if
you do want to follow a story god the
time limit makes it so intense
with the palm is giving you nightmares
story I got I got this plum I'm locked
down nothing to fear
beat Adam but
yeah
miss penny fuck your spin attackdon't mind me I'm just gonna eat all
your food
you're wondering what Adam did that was
wrong there's actually he is a hostage
on that roller coaster I'm just saving
these guys first then I'm gonna go back
to the roller coaster and save the
hostage
I owe you one fantastic yeah
follow me
why do I keep trying to walk out windows
what's wrong the big follow me
actually don't you guys wait right here

is why I love giving the AI shotguns
come on it's the gift that keeps on
giving
these mini chainsaw so cheap so cheap so
effective now we're going for no depth I
would feel bad using these we're here
right I'm away again I'm away one more
house oh that was so dirty using these
I'm gonna need my shotgun back Roger
thanks ooh wow well one of those funny
better try not to abuse them so one will
be plenty
follow me
follow me
Thanks
Brandon I didn't see you come up I mean
hand here what what gives
considering the helicopter and all we
have to work together
but that doesn't mean we can tell you
everything and everything we do tell you
can't necessarily be printed yeah so so
I just want you to appreciate the
situation well we're up to our night I
have not seen Maggie I've seen the
trailers fine and it looks good it looks
nothing like an Arnold Schwarzenegger
movie though which is a good thing I
still can't believe all this you know I
think that's not a good there's plenty
of Exodus Tony a good classic movies but
I mean I didn't think he had it in him
to do something that actually looked
like drama you all right there yeah I
got it
you should rest a while Brad
you go ahead and catch some sleep first
we can switch in four hours okay
yeah
yeah oh my throw power went up well
that's that's terribly useful
oh I still got that Japanese book why
didn't I put that down earlier oh well
live and learn
live and learn
yes actually
elevator music going on I still got that
in my head dead undead and under
what twitch twitch said it was off one
map twitches twitches line I've been
I've been successfully so far
yeah
you haven't come back for this summer
right interrupted shits going down for
real
I like to think that after this game
Frank Frank tracked
Otis down and murdered him I like to
think that's a thing that happened it's
a zombie apocalypse you care about phone
etiquette
look mister if we're gonna fight these
zombies we need guns electrician named
zombies bad as far as I can throw that's
just people even less don't shoot
look pop this okay talk to my 12-gauge
don't get no closer to kingdom come
doc my 12-gauge situation like this
you
hey this fight I hate this fight so much
damn mister what are you crazy
you want you want good so bad
and so I have gone down the road of mini
chainsaw abuse though then again oh it's
- Cletus is a fucking power
all right
where's the next rescue area somewhere
that's a coffee creamer you've got
yourself there I'll be taking that
talk to me goddammit
then I have inventory room for the cream
oh well oh well
you know the best escorts are the ones
you need to carry you're carrying them
essentially makes you grab proof like
they took it easy on you when they
design those those little escort
missions like yeah that's hard enough
it's gotta carry a man the grabs will
work
I got some time to kill where the next
motion starts I might I might level off
by taking a picture taking tour of the
mall
yes this is a no deathrun attempt trying
to get the best ending possible I'm
already not going to save everybody

photochallenge Posada
it's going to be a while before I beat
the game yet you're getting tired just
go to sleep
you can watch the rebroadcast and find
out if I pulled it off what happened
Oh
I can't where's your worthless ass yeah
you gotta be always fucking over there
don't ya
beginner's luck that's all let's have
one more just one more contest Frank be
here tomorrow at noon we'll settle this
what's Dead Rising 2 any word yet the
present is good it comes in two flavors
off-the-record in their own vanilla the
regular Dead Rising 2 stars a new main
character who's kind of a boring schmuck
then off the record stars this this
character of Frank West bass the same
basic game though they just changed the
main character and made some minor story
alterations I had time to cheese it up
you can't tell me actually no party
wasn't feeling off the record wasn't DRI
DLC and that was a whole standalone game
they sold Coverley I'm right aren't I
you are nothing but a you son by the
time I'm done beating information out of
you
and for death to come take you away Dead
Rising 3 cycles are based off the seven
deadly sins that just sounds retarded
oh yeah
Oh
testing
where's analyst address that
you over there
here take this when you guys talk about
the silent protagonist versus a talking
protagonist just done in but I'll take a
technical talks anytime I was think
silent protagonist are weird I heard her
scream people respond to you as if
you're saying things and you're not
hey I hated everything
white suddenly
unless your protagonist is like some
kind of Clint Eastwood to ask a badass
that just doesn't talk much it wasn't
over
and
yes even even link I don't hate link but
I prefer for typing protagonist
yeah
there's the dress
Oh
yes gotcha Thanks
Follow Me Go you fucking kidding me
we're gonna be crying you can't have the
shotgun
over there
follow me
follow me
what a nose kick
follow me
over there
we're rescuing the fat guy called Ronald
shit
yes fantastic and of course she wants
food
nothing nothing subtle here
go
come on

[Part II]
Nope, not getting that chainsaw back from you.
Fuck it.
You know what, I'll get another one in the next area.
Fuck it.
This is not rocket science.
You jump up and climb the thing.
Somebody climb up there.
This is the least forgiveable thing, when they get caught up on that, on that shelf.
Fucker already wants food.
So what do I get with that?
Skill, what do I get, what do I get?
Roundhouse kick.
Lift Up.
All right.
All right.
I'll take Lift Up.
Fifteen minutes to kill before the next case starts.
I don't wanna drop that.
About time I started getting some stock upgrades, though.
Jesus Christ.
I have not seen The Vacation trailer, so I can't, I can't comment on it.
I know you're asking about it.
I don't, I don't know anymore.
I know nothing.
I know what's-his-face from The Office is going to be in it.
That's, that's everything I know.
It's a good run so far.
I, I'd be fucking delighted, I'd be, I'd be ecstatic if I didn't lose Leia and, uh, Gordon, the coward.
So, I can't save this game without overwriting my, my fully-leveled save, and I'm, I'm kinda terrified that I'm gonna have some kind of game-ending glitch.
And we won't be able to restart from the glitch.
Living on the edge, is what I'm saying.
Let her die?
Why would I let her die?
I love that Frank was just, he was just gonna let this happen and take pictures of it.
That was hard.
Shit, it's out of my reach.
Fuck.
Why would you start...
Always hold hands.
That's the, that's the lesson here.
Holding hands will let you go through the zombie acopalypse untouched.
Shit.
Ooh, Attack Up, that's nice.
All right, that was a minor setback in time.
A little bit of orange juice.
Coast is clear enough.
I don't have my mighty chainsaw.
That could be a problem.
Could be.
I can always...
My brain, my brain is doing things.
Excuse me while my brain does things.
I got time, yeah, I'm gonna do that first.
Looking for a queen here.
Not for that.
What are you gonna do, you know.
And now I'm seeing things.
None of you guys have got a queen?
I can't lose that weapon.
Not for the fight that's about to come.
Hamburgers smell me?
Fuck.
All right.
Take his shotgun.
No, you just wanna hold hands.Fuck you.
Take that shotgun.
Maybe a chainsaw.
It would've saved me a shitload of time.
I think I got enough to spare.
That's more like it.
You two just stand there and shoot at zombies.
I'm gonna take care of this business.
All right.
Nick killed her?
That's great!
Unexpected, but great.
My brother, Nick.
All right.
Sorry.
Didn't mean to hurt you.
Oh, my throw got upgraded.
Oh.
That's the last thing I needed.
Uh, we'll go down this way.
The pathfinding is not the best.
What are you guys waiting for?
Everyone get down off the stairs.
All right.
Now you're off the stairs.
Now you follow me to the bathroom.
All right.
Nick, you can, you can use that shotgun anytime you want.
Help yourself.
What's going on?
What's going on?
You guys, you know, go to the bathroom.
Sally.
Sally.
In the bathroom.
It's not creepy.
Just follow me into the woman's room.
Oh, shit.
I think he would've gassed me.
That would've been bad.
Where's the fucking bee?
Nick, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but let's all run to the door.
Run to the door.
Run to the door.
Janet, I also appreciate your enthusiasm, but not the time.
Why are you...oh, I must've mispointed.
I gotta be close enough.
Nick is the man!
What's going on?
What's going on?
Do I have to kill every zombie here before you'll move on?
Appreciate the enthusiasm, but we're on the clock.
We're on the clock.
Now you can start shooting again.
What are you waiting for me for?
Get up, get up there.
Climb, climb.
Why is this the hardest thing you've ever had to do?
Why?
I've got t-, time, time, time.
All right.
I need to get at that door.
Oh, fuck!
Jesus fucking Christ.
All right.
This is about to get serious.
I'm gonna do this first.
I don't know if I should.
I should probably do girl-hunting first.
Shit.
Shit.
No, I'm not.
Main story comes first.
Main story comes first.
Oh, god.
Or should it?
No.
No, I'll do this first.
This is dumb.
This is dumb.
I wish I had more quickstep, but by the time I make more quickstep, it won't, I won't, it won't save me the time I want it to save me.
I wish I had quickstep.
Fuck off.
You little motherfucker!
Die!
All right.
Ain't time for fucking around.
Fuck off, Otis!
What are you doing?
Where are you, woman?
That was weird.
Hurry the fuck up, Floyd.
Hurry the fuck up.
On the clock.
Dear Lord, am I leveling up, though.
Always hold hands.
Everyone's gonna die while I'm holding hands because you couldn't run.
You pushed me, too, but...
Floyd.
Oh, boy, this game.
This game.
Yeah, you do.
That's why you better climb up here fast for me.
Come on.
Rachel.
Rachel.
Climb the stoop.
If I miss out on the major case file because you couldn't climb up on a stoop, I'm going to come back to the safe house and murder you.
Do you understand me?
Do you, do you understand me?
I can't remember, I can't forget to feed Ronald, because Ronald's a fucking fatass.
And if I don't feed Ronald, he's gonna have a mutiny, and I'm gonna lose half these survivors.
So we're gonna feed fucking Ronald.
Just give him the chips so we can go.
Give him the chips.
Give him the chips!
Get some orange juice going.
Hope my chainsaw lasts long enough to defeat Isabella.
I was gonna say kill, but I wish I wouldn't kill her.
I hope not.
I like Isabela.
Not played Dead Rising 3.
It's $60, and everyone says it's bad.
All right.
To the boss fight.
We're gonna have time.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Should I go to the chainsaw?
I should grab a chainsaw.
I would be, I would be foolish not to.
Because I have the time.
All right.
Feel so cheap using this chainsaw.
They haven't given me much choice...fucking A.
All right, all right.
Oh, boy.
I hate this fight.
Stop, and let me chainsaw you to death.
Yes!
So, what am I, about halfway done here?
Dear Lord.
Little bit of time to kill.
Little bit of time to kill.
Oh, whoops.
Ooh, I know where that came out.
The stream can't be that good, I'm hardly saying anything.
I make mixed drinks.
All right, now if you want to know the next most likely place this run is gonna bite it, um...if we're considering, if we're considering the run ending when the, like, if I fail the main story, and not just die, possibly in the tunnels.
It's been a while since I've been through those tunnels, and I don't remember the layout near as well as I used to.
So, uh, probability of dying there is, or at least failing the main mission there, the main story, is, uh, decent.
So now I'm worried about the tunnels.
Oh, I lost my bike.
But in, in, what a fashion, though.
What is the queen item?
That's a, that's a bee.
That's a, it's actually, the, the zombies in this game are the product of a parasitic wasp.
So, kill the, kill the bee that's in a jar, and all the nearby zombies collapse.
Those little green things floating around?
Those are zombie larvae.
Zombie bee larvae.
The zombies in this game are zom-bees.
How many more boss fights are there?
I'm not sure how many boss fights there are, numerically.
I'm gonna say I'm about halfway through the game?
You can go to bed.
I'm not forcing anybody to stay.
It is gonna be a long stream.
Oh, I know what I need to do.
Almost get some ammo.
Get out of the way.
Otis, I know.
I should've brought Otis.
I'm gonna get a shotgun before I forget.
Why do the guns in this game suck?
Uh, because it's a melee-focused game.
That's why the guns in this game suck.
Then why have them?
Uh, cuz some people might enjoy them.
They're, they're also not bad to give to survivors.
Survivors are pretty good to have a shotgun on their hands.
Oh, he has his own shotgun.
I didn't need to grab mine.
Oh, well.
Oh, Kindell, you're already there.
Kendall, you're great.
You're great except for when you try to have a mutiny later.
But, we'll deal with that then.
Right now, I need a shotgun, and you have one.
Kindell.
Counting on ya, buddy.
Counting on ya.
You keep shooting, Kindell.
You're the man.
I don't think the convicts were gone.
I think I was just lucky enough that they didn't spawn near me out there.
Your man, Kindell.
Shoot, shoot, shoot.
Do I have any zombie juice?
Oh, I do.
Can I get myself through the door?
Yes, I think you are.
All right.
Essentially in the clear.
I like that, uh, Kindell is wearing a tux.
He was, he's having a fancy zombie apocaplyse.
To him, this is an excuse to dress up.
All right, I got, uh, time to kill for a change.
Ooh, my attack went up.
That's good.
What are my skills looking like right now?
Not bad, not bad.
Item stock's looking good.
Knee Drop.
Ooh, we got the Suplex.
Hammer Throw.
What level am I at?
I'm doing good with leveling.
34, all right.
Whiif.
Ah, yeah.
Attack feels good.
Nice.
Nice.
This is fun.
Oh, all right.
I can get, I can get Floyd his wine.
I got time to kill
That seems like a fine thing to do right now.
Yes, I, I do know Dead Rising.
Uh, I'm just, I'm terrified about tunnels now because I no longer remember the most efficient route through them, and, uh, that section of the game is going to give me a heart attack.
Goodbye, baseball bat.
I'm a bare hand it.
So, you know what...
I've got time.I've got time.
Oh, yeah.
This is going down.
Furlay.
Rich, yep, there we go.
Furlay!
What was that, what was that.
You know, it's day three.
I don't think the convicts spawn again.
I think that's the last of them because it's after midnight, day three.
So they're, they're gone.
Lost my way.
I wanna go that way.
This is, this is a gigantic mall, but the park is, like, twice as big as the mall is.
This doesn't make any sense.
Oh, shit, I lost the chainsaw.
Get outta my way.
Otis, this is not the damn time.
Yeah, I should've grabbed another chainsaw.
I didn't think I was that low on, uh, health.
I'm kinda shocked, uh, it broke.
But...
We'll be fine.
Yeah, those three magazines aren't doing me a lot of good.
I, I do not have the Mega Buster, or the Mega Sword, if that was your question.
If I'm slurring, it's because I'm undergoing Dead Rising fatigue.
I think, first rule of zombie apocalypse is, uh, don't, don't turn your back on the guy who was just turning into a zombie.
Maybe that was a bad idea, Frank.
Oh, I'm not quitting.
I'm not that tired.
We're doing this shit.
It's going down.
Uh, Mopar, you're, you're wrong, I actually do have, uh, Dead Rising: Off the Record on Steam.
I got both Dead Rising: Off the Record, and, uh, another one, Dead Rising 2.
What if this game never ends, Rich?
If this game never ends, that means I've successfully completed my no-death run.
Where's the timer?
This game's gonna end.
And, no save.
Oh, boy.
No safety nets.
No safety nets.
All right.
Time to take care of some more business.
Problem is I have a lack of chainsaws, and a boss battle to get to.
Do I take time to get the chainsaw?
I think I have to.
Yeah, it's not gonna take me that far out of my way.
I feel, I really do feel so cheap using those, those small chainsaws, but it is a no-death run from level one.
I think I've earned it.
Fuck.
Oh, wait, I don't wanna drop that now.
Travel first, then drop.
Eh, fuck it.
All right, I've never used the, um, mini gun in a boss battle before, so this should be fun.
Yeah, I know, I know my Dead Rising 1, but those tunnels are terrifying me. 
I no longer remember the most efficient route through there.
And the time, the time constraints of that section of the game, oh, that's gonna be a fucking nightmare.
All right, that was a little bit effective.
All right.
Don't need that.
I definitely want that board.
Brainwashing tips.
Oh, shit.
Forgot about that.
Where are you going?
Get away from them.
It's all right, I brought food.
Get off my back.
Get away.
All right, we need to arm you guys.
I almost forgot my, uh, big gun.
Oh, I f-, forgot I can't kick with this.
Forgot I can't kick.
Are we missing somebody?
I'll go back to the theater, make sure everyone's rescued.
Who is missing?
Nobody left behind in here.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Glad I did a head count.
Come on, get your ass in gear.
You guys are armed.
Why are you having problems?
Ray.
Ray.
Come on now.
Really?
Really, Ray?
Almost out of minigun.
Be careful there, BEth.
Nathan.
Oh, okay, back.
Everybody bettet be right behind me.
I know, I know Beth is nearly gone.
First things first, first things first.
We're almost there.
Beth, Beth, stay, stay, stay safe.
All right.
Oh, Jesus H.
Did I forget to get Frank his wine?
Oh, goddammit.
That's fine.
Oh, I've got time to kill.
Again.
But I did fuck up a wine side-quest.
At least these fucking cultists are gone.
This door, all right.
Really?
Where'd he go, where'd he go?
Do I waste a quickstep?
I think I should.
I don't want to.
I'm gonna need it.
I know I'm gonna need it later.
I'm not gonna do it now.
One more fucking hit.
Fuck you, Paul.
Fuck...
There!
I gotta work faster.
All right.
If I'm right, there should be another case over here.
But I didn't get the call fixed.
I doubt it's available.
Nope.
What are you stuck on?
I like the tight tight limits, the tight time limits, I like that it's not easy to save all the survivors.
But they should be able to find their way out of a damn store.
Oh, no, don't, come on, I didn't mean to hit that button.
You guys stay where you were.
Gil, I'm gonna save Paul first.
Just don't kill anybody with that.
All right.
You, you head over there, Gil.
I'm gonna...
Oh, good.
Everything's syncing up here.
I won't be able to carry it.
Fuck it.
Gil, where are you?
I love this game.
Oh, goddammit, Paul.
I gave you a knife.
Oh, no, no.
I was trying to carry Gil.
Come on, Leroy.
Fucking drunk.
Come on, Debbie Downer.
Oh, give me my sword back dammit.
Stop taking my sword.
Fuck it.
While I'm here...
Don't wanna neglect the necessities of life in the zombie age.
Hurry up, I gotta collect Gil.
Get to the choppa!
Oh, shit.
You're fine.
Let's level up.
Oh, I didn't mean to do that there.
Fuck it.
Fuck it, it's fine.
When I level up, I'll get my health back.
It'll be fine.
I should level up here.
Somer-, Somersault Kick?
That's fine, that's fine.
I want the, the Gut Puncher.
Let's see if I can save old what's-her-face, or has she not spawned yet?
Yep.
All right.
Take my hand, Susan.
Ugh, shit.
Come on, old lady.
You know what, she is one of my favorite survivors, Susan here.
Here we are, day, day three in the mall of the zombie apocalypse.
The really, before Frank West shows up at the mall, the zombie apocalypse has already been going on for a few day, few days.
So here, look at this little, this little old lady managed to make it out on her own for, like, five days of nightmare zombie hell.
She's a tough old broad.
I love her.
I always gotta go out of my way to save Susan.
Come on, Susan.
I got, I got cases to solve.
I've got a sinister zombie plot to stop.
And I'm, I'm taking time out to escort you because, because you're wonderful.
You're a wonderful little old grandma who's tough, but I got places to go, people to see, zombies to slice up, same people to kill...
All right.
I might be able to do it.
I'm concerned about kind of sort of getting lost in the tunnels, and not being remembering the most efficient way through.
I'm worried about losing a lot of time.
Can't save.
What skill did I get?
Ooh, Face Crusher, Karate Chop.
All right, all right.
I just want the Gut Ripper.
I'll be happy when I get the Gut Ripper.
Do I have my face cut?
I didn't even notice.
Come on, Otis.
Just knock 'em back.
Goddamn you, Otis!
Oh, I got turned around, turned around.
Not good, not good.
Shit.
Shit.
Forgot all about our friend, Kent.
Fucking Kent.
Uh, yeah, we're doing the Kent thing.
I've come too far to skip Kent.
All right.
All right.
I should.
Do I lose all my items with the, the Kent thing?
I don't recall.
I'll find out.
Oh, nice.
Zombie free.
Tad.
That was very rude.
Now I remember why day three would drive me nuts.
It's all coming back to me.
All coming back to me.
This is why I needed to be good with the efficient routes, because, I, yeah, all this shit that crops up.
CD store, not there.
Okay.
Wrong store, wrong store.
Oh, I don't want to give you that.
Oh, shit.
All right.
Cuz I'm never gonna get it back from you.
So I'll need that.
I love thords.
Oh, Tad.
Oh, whatever.
Let's just get in the warehouse, come on.
Come on, come on, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, and there we go!
Don't, uh, don't forget to talk to Kindell.
Gotta talk to Kindell.
Can't forget to talk to Kindell.
This game is great.
We still have hours of game, but right here, some of the stuff that, uh, I think is the hardest is, is, is, is what we're kind of in the thick of.
This, this bomb time thing, still saving these people, cuz I'm a nut who has to save everybody.
Where's Kindell?
Where's that fucker, Kindell?
Who are all these fucking people?
Kindell's not in here.
There we go.
Kindell...
Look at this, we got a small society going on up here.
Oh, my god.
All right.
All right.
Now, now we're gonna take care of those bombs.
And this is why I was worried about playing.
Cuz I know I wanted to save those people, because I always save the fucking people, and I wasn't gonna have the full amount of time possible to do this mission.
Oh, boy.
Get off of me, you fucker.
Is that the Kurlan naiskos?
Thank god I killed those Jeep fuckers.
Oh, boy.
I think there's one up here, right?
I think so.
I hope so.
Get on that bike, get on that bike, get on that bike.
Next one is...I don't remember where they all are.
Get off the bike, Frank.
Did he blow up my bike?
He blew up my bike.
This is bad.This is bad.
But, secret weapon.This is ridiculous, but it works.
I can deal with this.
I assume the arrow is the direction I'm headed.
I hope it is.
Oh, man.
I'm as far away as I could be.
Eh, not really.
Horseshoeing, right? 
Right.
All right.
Holy shit.
2 A.M., huh?
All right.
All right.
I know there's three more people I can save.
I think they're doomed.
They might be doomed.
Right, left, right.
PizzaTrain11, that's a very good question.
Where is it, where is it, where is it?
There it is.
Left, right, left.
All right.
All right, we're going for it.
Fuck it.
All right.
That chainsaw's gotta last.
I don't think I have enough time to go back for another one.
Did he just call her a son of a bitch?
Time is running out.
You guys make up your mind.
Thank you.
You guys have assault weapons.
Could you shoot the zombies?
Oh, I got my Gut Ripper, finally.
All right.
Oh, shit.
We're down one?
Where's he at?
He's stuck on a door, isn't he?
I know it.
Tactical decision to let these people die.
He's gonna die, and I don't care.
I am...
If it gets too close, I'm fucking running on you guys.
It might be too late now.
They're gonna die, and I don't care.
Point of no return.
Tactical decision: they're dead. 
They're not.
I'm not fucking this whole run up because of that.
I think I accidentally killed her.
Oh, well.
If you guys can't keep up, I don't care.
Uh, I'm not gonna make it, third day.
Fuck it.
Fuck it.
They're dead.
It's been decided.
It's been decided.
I feel bad, but this run's been too amazing to let die.
Fuck.
Come on, Izzy.
Oh, I gotta talk to you?
All right, I guess that makes sense.
Oh, is she waiting for him to die?
Oh, motherfucker.
Brett is not dying fast enough.
Oh, fuck!
You know what, fuck it.
By the time I get back, he'll be dead.
And then can take...aw, son of a bitch.
Oh, god.
Uh-oh.
You better not be froze.
You better not be frozen.
This is bad.
This is bad.
This is bad.
I, I couldn't save without overwriting my, my game.
Because I wanted to start from level one, saving was not an option.
Come on.Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
It's, I've, I've come too far.
Please don't do this to me, you fucking piece of shit.
You fucking piece of crap.
Ugh...
Well, this sucks.
This sucks.
RollWoll, Rich reads Stardust.
And, Priv-, WhitePrivilegeMexican, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
Wow.
This sucks.
This really sucks.
I mean, that was good.
That was starting from level one.
I had a clear path to total fucking victory.
Total fucking victory.
So I lost five survivors.
I lost Leia.
I lost Gordon.
Then I lost the three gun nuts.
Gun nuts, it was on them.
Fucking idiots.
Ugh...
It was, it was, it was, it was in the palm of my hand.
The palm of my goddamn hand.
Fuck you.
All right, I'm gonna take a potty break, and maybe, maybe this thing will just unfreeze itself.
I don't know.
I'll be back.
It's done.
I did try to eject the disc.
I don't know how to react to that.
I really, really wanted to pull it off tonight.
Really wanted to pull it off.
Thank you, everybody, for showing up.
I, I hope you had a good time watching me nearly no-death run Dead Rising.
I can't even say I died.
This did not end because of a death.
This ended because of a goddamn hardware failure.
All right, everybody.
Thank you, thank you for showing up.
I'm gonna take off now.
I've got stuff to do tomorrow, and, uh, I'm gonna try again.
Obviously, not, not tonight.
And I don't know exactly when it's gonna be.
I's just, when I'm in the mood, I'm gonna set up another fucking secret stream, and we'll, we'll see what happens.
We'll see what happens.
All right.
Good night.
