2:23pm: "Jack Solo Stream™ Tonight around 8:30pmCDTish. Rich is going to Chicago to look for some sort of Figure Skating trophy." (archive.vn/du6r8)

[Part I]
it's quite possible that right now I'm
streaming it's starting
and we want to play some risk of rain
today I'm hoping Rick and Jay Rick and
Jay here at here again no it's just a
jack Saul's dream hello welcome Thank
You mr. Frey smile for the heads up to
everyone audio and video is good good
good I've watching crappy ads for you
Thank You Krieger I appreciate that all
those ads Frosty's news it has been a
while since I've played a risk of rain
and I think about risk of rain a lot as
I listen to the soundtrack
and I just want to play I I have a bunch
of games in my Steam inventory from the
Steam sale that I'm gonna play but I
just wanted to play some risk of rain
because it's been too long since I
played a risk of rain so we're just
gonna make sure the game is better co-op
but a lot easier so I would believe both
of those statements oh and there's the
email there is the email yeah rich rich
is going to Chicago tonight because his
Blackhawks won some sort of trophy cup
and so he is going to Chicago to watch
the parade tomorrow and didn't want to
have to drive there tomorrow morning so
can I sing smash now for you
what what's the what's with the
resurgence in Smash Mouth so buddy
you once told me
grayton Dungeon Master Blaster really
great timing did I make him a trophy out
of PVR no I really thought he would I
really thought he would like that story
about about the trophy made a few guy
but apparently he didn't ok who we're
gonna play a let's say let's just start
with the standard commando right because
it's more fun and something you should
know is it has been a while since I have
played risk of rain
Thanks chance to launch and mortar we'll
take that
good evening just a Norman well come to
the screen
and I'm in a very excited player is
karima this is such such a good game
oh my god a teleporter right away jelly
jelly uh we're not necessarily excited
about ourselves rich and I have finally
seen all of the conference's we just
shot the episode today in fact I was
thinking I was really hard to bading
streaming just streaming me editing the
episode because we do want to get it
done so quick there's just too much to
edit inside in mana I didn't want to
edit it I didn't want to edit it why
because there's too much there's just
too much to edit I'm gonna explore a
little bit more
nice so maybe you know I like you know
I'd love to all of my audio is intact
great I'm excited for that I will I will
I will edit an episode live that's just
something I think would be fun but it's
it's just it's all the raw footage now
so you just have to listen to rich and I
Bowl either which I guess will you do
anyway but there's no game footage it's
just also watching rich and I blather I
think that's the real problem so
anything in Premiere CC 2015 that I like
absolutely and there's a bunch a chest
long just fireworks there's a bunch of
new items in the game that I have not
playing with it all right that's oh
that's right there's a wolf button you
forget about all these things face
warmly edit warp edit is the thing that
I will use the most where it takes two
clips
and kind of mesh meshes them together I
will use that often with rich and eyes
haha fireworks it's great that's great
everything about this game is great
didn't know if you knew that of course
that's what we do every week I know mr.
shai's now you listen to us blather but
you know you would have to watch us
blather and I think that's where the
problem with that is where the problem
lies that's where that's where it turns
into an offense that's where like I
don't even like watching this father
if I if I was a little further along we
had to we it was supposed to be one day
of watching all of the events and it
turned into two days of watching all the
events because I assumed that the events
were an hour long and some of them are
like two and a half three hours long and
that's just too long it's too long I
can't take it I can't take two and a
half hours so it went a little bit
longer than I thought it would and that
means I still have to import footage and
that was the real thing actually I
instead
a sailor like this he that's fine that's
fine
this is the term world like me don't
start a thing rogue like used to mean
like the game rogue but now it just
means elements of the game rogue
something like replayability
procedurally generated levels Hard
difficulty much like the game of broke
well I think that syringe gives me
something good I don't want that story
increased attack speed nice yes I keep
on that syringe great the outside drawn
my like drums I'm a big fan of
guerrillas in this game
oh yeah I want that oh man I I was so
I'll be talking about 83 tonight just
because why not right
I was so disappointed with Nintendo's e3
event I've never I've never they talked
about Star Fox and then they spent the
next 45 minutes talking about plastic
toys that you could buy it was
infuriating I get it amigos are very
popular but I don't care about them I
want three attack drums great Super
Mario maker yeah Super Mario maker isn't
great
and all the amiibos that you can use
with Super Mario maker that's gonna be
even better right don't you dig all via
me Bo's
me Bose the future hate it I hate it
I need amiibos I think they're dumb but
that's just me I know everyone everyone
else likes them get that
right
here
lotta enemies
drones I don't like anything Jack I'm
like rich that way right you know I try
not to be I tried not to be like rich I
try not to be so cynical and as you all
know I am a hardcore Nintendo fanboy
hardest of the hardcore nintendo fanboys
and even even the soley soley
disappointed in their e3 showings and
starfox let's be honest it's not about
graphics but it looks terrible the new
Metroid game is great I hope it still
plays like all the new Metroid game also
looks ugly as sin and didn't they learn
their lessons with with Metroid Prime
hunters like no one cares no one cares
about handheld Metroid and handheld
multiplayer Metroid no new IPs
Skylanders so skylander toys and amiibos
that can double as Skylanders so we have
that going for us and that great know
what you say no it's not great no it's
not great I guess if you're into
Skylanders and amiibo is great by him
not
they don't like it
a little flame e-guide things it's fun
place ago
I don't know Skylanders are an
incredible feat if you
once a use item we use item
don't use items we want passive items
passive items Ile they're incredible
waste money that's exactly what they are
but they make a ton of money so I
understand oh my god pardon him
I understand anyone wanting to make a
Skylander earn amiibo because then just
make so much money
ooh double jump
oh I understand it's a huge feature on
the way you the amoebas are a huge
feature on the Wii U but I don't I still
don't like them
a boom
I don't like them and I'm not quite sure
what they add to gameplay yet
everything's boom we're doing great so
far I feel good about my items increase
oh that's a great one to get increases
your help a boom
so yeah Nintendo was infuriating Xbox
was insulting ps4 had some interesting
things and Bethesda was nice even though
I you know I don't really much care for
Bethesda as you guys saw me play
I have no allegiance to Bethesda you
know you guys watch me play Fallout and
that's about it that's about all I know
Bethesda but they seem to actually care
about the games that they were chilling
I think that's rare
I know III of disappointment what a
shocker
III used to be you know it used to be
the place you got all your news from and
we just don't need it anymore we don't
need all the news anymore because we
have the Internet
I've been ready for the bows I think I'm
ready for the boss
when you say you watch to all the
conference's that yes I watch the pc-12
and I thought that was that was kind of
pointless there there wasn't a lot of
new information given a lot of the
people that came out to speak for the PC
conference were just rehashing what they
had already told and other press
conferences I did I thought there their
gaming box was neat and their new
graphics card looked fun and DS new
graphics card looked cool but you know
the talk show style was a little awkward
if anyone has seen any PC game economy
it was
as one it was
she has to walk
how could you here's here's how you
improve on III get rid of the shows not
III in general keep ether in general
keep the conference have to have the
booths have the other smaller developers
but get rid of the pomp and circumstance
get rid of
get rid of the show because you don't
need it you know
you don't need the show then what
happens is these smaller developers and
get equal footing the big guys don't get
so much press and we get all the
information without all the bit of the
bullshit because that's all it is it's
almost you these game trailers with no
gameplay its its salesmanship without
any Flair and we don't need it we just
don't need it all we want is information
you know tell me what games are coming
out tell me why I should buy our system
now
that one that's that one Oh Jack I must
know about the order to write but they
could just give them you don't need a
show and they're not you don't need a
show and they're not good at it that's
the real thing we don't need the show
anymore week we could get the exact same
thing with a list of upcoming games and
then we wouldn't have to deal with the
house all the time it takes to watching
these things that the unnecessary hype
oh oh pardon me Oh hold on for a moment
sorry I have a bit of a sore throat rich
and I have done a lot of good music in
this game the best music in this game
rich and I have done a lot of talking
over the past couple days a my throat is
a little sore
you know or how about this how about
this for the conference's instead of one
big Microsoft conference break it up
into smaller chunks so we actually get
to talk about some of the games that was
one of the most infuriating parts of e3
hold on was one of those of yearning
parts of e3 was they show a clip of a
game not tell you anything about it you
don't know anything about the gameplay
like like that uh I'm trying to think
what was the one the one with the robot
dog in the Xbox the one with the robot
dog in the Xbox who are right not
horizon it's Jack oh no you know what
this is a this is a Pepsi I'm not I am
not drinking beer tonight
no no snack tonight that was there that
was it's a very tiny can of Pepsi recore
recored
yes recore okay so recore right what do
we know about recore nothing we know
absolutely nothing about recored there's
a lady with a robot dog they didn't show
any gameplay footage they didn't even
tell you what kind of game is it is it
it is it an action game is it an MMO is
it a resource gathering game a real-time
strategy game we know nothing about
recore right it looked meets the the
visuals looked really fun but we know
nothing about it so how about you give
the developers a little time to actually
talk about their freakin game
I love this double jump because it means
I can avoid fall damage and then they
talk about a game and we can actually
make informed decision on what games
were gonna buy it would be it would be
crazy town
and would love that would love that but
no no we get we get five seconds of
cinematic and then we're on to the next
one we're on to what's the Daisy guy
making you know he's making a space game
which we also know nothing about we know
nothing about the space game that the
Daisy guy is making what kind of game is
it I don't know I couldn't tell you he
didn't tell me this is the new the new
Daisy guy game that's all I know
way-hey
great but and I didn't you know this
might be the old man in me but I don't
think it's always been this way I want
to say that at one point like they
showed new games you know I don't think
it's a crazy I don't think it's a crazy
thing to ask them to show us a new game
these are drawn I'm gonna fuckin Laser
droning
and that PC conference I was very bored
just very very bored
it went out with you on the PC
conference went on for far too long was
it like two and a half hours for that PC
campus that's way cool okay I'm very
sorry can you laughter kills
oh no no bother I don't think I'm sick
because Gruber I think it just so
happened that I was drinking your beer
and when I was at the start of a cold
now I'm in for a cold a sore throat
I'm just kind of cold don't worry I'm
sure it has nothing to do
well maybe does haha I don't know I
don't know how's my voice sounding in
general I did I got a new microphone and
I'm pretty pretty excited about it
I got a microphone and I got a pop
filter so you can't hear my heart pees
like a sex joke what I recommend for
people who don't particularly like beer
is not drinking beer you don't have to
and you know you shouldn't feel forced
in social situations to drink beer it's
not something necessarily into drink
whatever you want to drink beer soda
water water great for you
I recommend water Jack faster at lower
house
gotta get out of here draw so my drones
can heal
yeah and up like your knees heal up my
drawings you my drones
what are my tattoos of I have a couple
tattoos I have my family as sticky
fingers on my arm and I have uh some
feet on the back of my arm footprints as
my family like my my mom's side of my
family are called the Blackfeet and I
think we were just called that because
we like to walk around barefoot and so
it's a family thing Jackie was
shockingly good at this game you know I
really enjoyed this a we get what we get
a chance to stun enemies yeah
neck's arm is a bag what III has always
been about trailers in height but I
would like it if they hype something
like they're not hyping anything I don't
feel anymore they're not like they're
not showing any gameplay no no I mean I
got him we got that too would I consider
playing tf2 tonight oh my god it's been
so long since i play tf2 absolutely
absolutely I would consider playing tf2
tonight if I will as another senator
another question we'll see we'll see how
risk of rain goes well let's we'll see
how far we can make it no risk of rain
first but absolutely aw it's been it's
been ages since I played
the Nintendo stream was chockful
gameplay though no a gameplay of starfox
and then a meet an enemy Bo's nothing
but amigos all amoebas all the time
I guess gameplay of Skylanders is still
gameplay but not being black care about
getting out of here there it is we had
one more powerup and then we'll go we'll
go for the teleporter
and miss rounds you with icicles nice
the Mario maker looks promising
well that didn't that didn't turn out
well at all
get out of here
I mean drones gonna leave that time
oh so many will just yell for a little
bit
reduces incoming damage exactly like a
dandy good idea these icicles dated
these icicles are people without the
great banth can you guys hear the
clacking of my controller tonight I love
it
I'm out of here we're kind of rocking it
right now I'm feeling pretty good about
this okay
boom boom
why is just reading so sensitive that's
a good joke
like now after the minute oh yeah mr.
shott smile you're right the the
Nintendo treehouse is exactly how all of
the conference's just just have little
chunks give me the little chunks
throughout the bay that's what I really
want
I just want little chunks of information
throughout the day came across the
teleported too quickly I'm not ready for
it yet sitting here packing during the
stream I'm in northern VA for four more
days moving to Philly that's exciting
moving to Philly or maybe it's not I
don't know maybe it's terrifying sounds
fun
I forgot I you know I didn't forget to
tweet I decided not to tweet because it
was mr. Jack's Austrian
I tweeted earlier what time I start and
I started about on time that's like a
that's just a jack solo strain we don't
need to it's not gonna be a fun one I
mean it's fun self-deprecating Jack so
Austria that's what it is
I was not fishing it sounded like it was
fishing and it's not I'm sorry little
boobies I like my boobies that those
used to like give you stuff and I don't
know if they don't anymore or what the
deal is without garbage cans
this is the best soundtrack this is the
best soundtrack ever Chris Kristen dulu
is the guy who does this I had listened
to this soundtrack constantly oh no
pterodactyls
pterodactyls are here
oh crap
the goats the goats
get out of here you go to goats don't
even know what's up
are you talking about Virginia Virginia
and expensive town to live in
I heard that yell I was really surprised
Jurassic world I talked to Jane about it
before I saw the episode and I was
really surprised that Jane likes
dissenting opinions on that usually
they're pretty spot-on I think it's fun
when they when they disagree I have not
seen Jurassic world yet just because I
honestly don't care that much
well you know to each of their own
no judgment or if you like it or not I
hear it's nicely schwanke as far as
movies go and I always enjoy cookie said
that's right you know it all depends on
who edits the half of the bag that's
that's that's who gets made fun of more
I think that wasn't that must have been
a Mike eddakath Jacob
it seemed like Jay got more drastic
world after bag and it's fun because we
got to do our e3 tie-in although Mike
didn't know what it was called and so in
the script he called the D s the big es
conference because my didn't know it was
called and that made me very happy
so I got the lead I've asked me if I
could come by to shoot a quick the
sketching and I was like sure it's like
a buying and I can't see this grabbed a
rough two es the big video game
conference in California I was gonna
breed it like that but rich in system
that we call the real thing more funny
our alum commentary tracks you know I'll
be honest with you I have not listened
to an rlm commentary track
well no rich isn't wrong on how
scientifically accurate Jurassic Park is
at the time it was scientifically
accurate he was relatively
scientifically accurate compared to say
a connoisseur but
they were using up-to-date information
when Jurassic Park get out of here get
out of here robot Oh what you know what
I'm sure I'm sure that the commentary
tracks are great thank you sit you know
I see those guys oh I see those guys all
time if I want to hear him talk I can
even talk yes teddy bear oh yes
teddy bear very strange thing to say
while playing a video game
now were you guys in the chat during the
during the e3 convention that is great
that is great I don't like it that you
guys hang out here I think this one
I think that is super cache and grenade
this double jump is just the bomb I need
to stop saying the bomb I just said the
bomb and it felt wrong so I apologize
for saying the bomb
I quit
meat nugget
but I have a rapid heal thing so I could
do that yeah things you know what things
are pretty boss up be honest with you
fine I'll rapidly here there's an onset
battle

one is about me I have that I've had
this like one dice above me in the
entire game and I have no idea what it
is that up crap
I shot the wrong way
everything's fine everything's fine
we're doing fine here are you like the
noises I like the noises
boss boss happened you don't need to

what that means that's great I'm very
about that I don't know if you guys can
hear biscuit in the background just me
ona's can't head off he's very upset
about something that double jump means I
get to move fast
you haven't got around to Dark Knight
Rises you don't need to see it you see
dark night that's all about you know
dark nights a good one Dark Knight Rises

Knight Rises is what led me not to see
interstellar I just don't care about
interstellar because dark now right this
was so man
you know
are you an Alan grant man or an Ian
Malcolm man I don't know necessarily who
those two people are I need more context

face if I want to say don't want to sell
who's anybody I just can't believe I
haven't lost a lot my drums
and there it is yes and I say that no
one says don't you let my drone buddy
yield up
how do you even see what you're doing is
something you might be wondering I don't
know I don't know I don't know how I'm
seeing what I'm doing I'm just shooting
do a robot roll call
robot roll call we're spending a crappy
day outside of combat yes if I got a
second cat what I named them sausage
that's a good question that is a good
and important question no the answer's
no see how far we can get this to go
once I revisit previous levels
you don't get excited about balafon well
you know rich was never a battlefront
person either I I liked battlefront
before the ps2 and I'm not that doesn't
get me excited for this battlefront
button in general general I'm interested
in seeing whatever what happens I feel
like I've already played the game now so
it's not gonna do much for me Oh robot
roll call
oh here's the thing I didn't want to
that much Mystery Science Theater I
didn't get the reference I'm sorry I'm
very sorry
wandering Vanga
Oh boom and boom
great
if you made that robot roll call Joe
when Joshua's here that would have gone
all gone over like gangbusters but I
think we've been over this I I have not
seen much Mystery Science Theater 3000 I
lost some weight he left on me
my drones are lost cows my drones are
lost cause I need to let that go
I need to let my drones down I love my
girls what I mean let them go I know
they're lost cause I should know better
we need more Josh we do need more Josh
she works a lot it's hard to convince
Josh to come out because you know
usually he's working and I hear that
many people enjoy eating
every night a joypad rep I enjoy the
things baby that you get I like food a
place to live so but I agree anymore -
got some meat does that count
fuck five five thousand oh fuck pot it's
Oh
been a while we had same talk about
5,000
go - I think you go - why no listen I
think on all fuck my five thousand
stream would be a terrible one you guys

hokey would
shit
this double magma one this is double
magnet

dingus sorry climbing down ladders
everything
and 11 that's where they will just get
all the items all the items in the world
who slew enemies out attack yeah get out
of here Meg normal boom oh I like the
thing that must be new what's my
favorite Indiana Jones movie probably
heart I think I've seen Temple of Doom
more times but I didn't dump a bit most
kind of like that no one that everybody
saw
our October governor this is the best
it's the greatest tempo Davis is a
little schlocky
but yeah you know and I even like Last
Crusade
I think last verse saying is a lot of
fun
a little a little strange wondrous to
like but does that clean dude guess
we'll never know
let the red goo up there
this is bombs you can see how far I can
make it keep redoing levels
it's not hard to make it all right
oh those are like those total guys some
readers
yeah like Raiders is so good do I call
it heart is so good oh Jesus place all
the enemies
okay we gotta stop fucking around whoo
there it is okay there it is okay here
we go yeah I mean less crusade is is a
great way to end it it's still so
shocking to me that they have a when
Dana revisited the Indiana Jones series
cuz Last Crusade was so beautiful
oh thanks great joys
and they're running away I still need
you my friend
running away doing damage is running
back and forth
all these idea
our bonus damage to healthy monsters
Christmas is Christmas girl never have
them I don't even know what you're
talking about
you're the weird one lesson movies
living this
everything stopped everything time we're
doing
back and forth back and forth

his ice doohickeys
you know I steal a key I speak from the
technical language that was the word

mean I don't mean to sound like Chris
Pratt he's lovable I can go back and get
all my drones all my falling drones you

the order plot is very bored what if you
die what was the most likely Krista cone
Chris Evans Hemsworth her pine nut Pratt
all of my drones give me all of my
drones you'll fire your machine-gun slow
me groans you would do by busy with my
sore throat it's very easy for me to do
my Palpatine do it

one more level and just try to get an
insane amount of items we're gonna try
to get an insane amount of items before
we go to the final they feel the speed
come back up there for another drone
okay so Chris Pratt should come mrs.
Doubtfire remake you know what I think
that's it I think that's the one
franchise I don't want to see in it call
me old-fashioned but I just don't think
he has the chops for mrs. Doubtfire
honey yeah it out of here
the stun the penguin the stun pickup
that I have is great because when I stun
it anything I get to knock him back
the enemies stay off my nuts for a
little bit longer his brain
we're having the fresh drone now y'all
back up for the drone
okay this is what we're doing now yes
they can be glob
not always engine whisper will resume
we're are risking it
you do to do hey I'm trying to kill risk
here guys
Hey
yeah
there we go yet no is
very tough I like this game I forgot how
much I like to say it's been a long long
time since I played this game hope it's
made you dig it that's it beg more
right
that's what sticking me out for my kid I
kept thinking I was gonna get I don't
know if I told you guys rich was
debating whether or not he wanted to
he's going to Chicago you know rich is
not here because he is going to Chicago
- apparently Chicago is having a parade
for the Blackhawks tomorrow and he
wanted to go early and yes I didn't he
didn't want to be up all night which is
why he's not here and he was debating
doing an all night stream and just
staying awake so he can catch like an
early train tomorrow and I called him
insane but he was debating it for a long
time whether that was the right call it
could have been great could have been a
terrible disaster
but he was thinking of you you know that
he wants to do a death row no he wants
to do no death run of Dead Rising 2 now
now that he got the Dead Rising 1 and I
think he's an insane person oh mai gerd
I probably should have killed this
Magnum first
we're doing fine
well way up here now
things are getting intense
are getting
whoa whoa
I have heard of me
and again once again no person all sorts
of buttons hold on I shoot people this
is the same view River it's kind of why
we love it shit can't stay still can't
stay still running away oh wait let me
do this my people did
and Kendall Foster
not a good look when I the boss view
with my boss queue at night this is the
important question all right here we go
we headed upon sad
he's around here somewhere
she rejected the joke re what
thank you and in Cuba
okay
no he's fine where is this guy how did
he get it stuck over here
area we got stuck
you dick in budge
good I'm glad you glitched I will take
care of everyone else while you glitch
out get all my drones back so there I'll
just sit here get home under Owens back
I'm talking about the Final Fantasy u7
trailer and what what a brick trailer
that was
I uh I've subset by so many thing to do
through the Final Fantasy 7 trailer was
the biggest with Wang curry because it
didn't even it didn't show anything all
showed was was cloud sword I was just
like yeah we rented and you know I
didn't even say Final Fantasy just said
remake that's like you know what this is
we're not even gonna tell you cuz we're
too cool of man I'm just too cool
pompous and yoshiya
is exactly what fanboys wanna you know
you're right like it's but it just
didn't
that kind of stuff shouldn't be at the
event
madam it sure yes it showed the Ford but
didn't you see the big Ford
nice he left two kills
we gotta go we're gonna go take care of
this scavenger or else he's going to
kick my ass with difficulty cows
you know a little bit okay it's a teaser
trailer not a game well pardon me for
wanting gameplay trailers for wanting
gameplay trailers at the gaming event
or at least give the creator's time
enough to talk about the game where that
was the other thing where you know they
show the teaser and then they're on to
the next thing now but I've had some
time to talk about everything
I think it would be cool
feel that
Square Enix has been making movies for
the better part of 15 years now right
you are so glitch scavengers
are so glitchy I'm so sorry
Stanford is pretty good but yes I don't
need the eggplant ibis prattling misper
happen I knew it would be mine now what
do you think I mean we've already made
it this far in the difficulty we should
probably just go until we can't go
anymore 70 minutes I'll do my longest
runway should we go maybe one more one
more level
maybe one more level and then we'll
finish it up we're doing pretty well
level am I at
you
rich and I shot are you three episode
today we watched all the we watched all
the III stuff yesterday and today we
shot the discussion today I'm editing it
I will edit it and kind of over the
weekend and hopefully have something
hopefully have something soon might be a
little sloppy
do-do-do-do-do great and we've started
already
let's go
yeah Cup it looks interesting I I don't
really know what kind of game it is it
looks like a like a platform round
shooter I've heard that it was a
turn-based RPG ish type game I'd love to
know some more about it but it'll never
everyone agrees that it looks cool
right that's the basic consensus is
everyone's like everyone agrees that
looks cool but we just don't know
anything about it
wouldn't it be great if there was some
sort of place where people didn't like
to talk about it for finishing crazy
my thing
do much crazy
I'm losing all my guys I'm losing all my
brownies
come on drowning Skinit live a huge
I gotta explore some you know explore
some I'm gonna find out
two items I wanted items glasses
still being honest
olynyk losses
public resonance
one
we have a bubble
you fellas
this time I don't know what that I don't
want to fight you anymore you're just
giving me the bullshit secrets vocalizes
what's the one Oh bother
Oh Oh bother your beer labels yes I
thought those were very funny your beer
labels which were a very elaborate
recrawl or very fine thank you
I appreciated that I appreciate it you
know it's it's hard it's hard to get
that elaborate of a rickroll going so I
really did
crazy we're just gonna activate this
an Aikido
you gotta keep
I can't read what it is because I'm
fighting everyone I'll come back for you
I would have come back for you
okay I didn't try I don't know if I
tried them all
I tried I want to say I tried two of
them and they were Rick Rawls and then I
got killed so I didn't I didn't want to
try anymore just in case they're all
right balls then it's just like I didn't
want to click on a recall eight times
there's basically
assuming they do that
here we go
as a father are there any games that I'm
excited for the kids to play so many too
many to account
so many too many you know like just when
their dexterity gets better and they're
able to handle a controller better yes
there are two minin and also movies
we've been talking about Jurassic Park
lately I was just like - young seventh -
young progressive farmer oh but I wanted
to see Jurassic Park so that love dress
it's like love dress apart so I say this
I can finish this mine
oh okay on the back you gotta get out
all my drum like the original drastic
park I want to say I saw over a dozen
times in the movie theater I kept going
back to see Jurassic Park
okay below drastic park
and what H will you introduce them to
Heather's oh my lord right that's always
the question what's the appropriate age
for anything really
case-by-case basis answer
Oh
so a case-by-case basis
some brain useless
great
pretty good actually
you should see Jurassic Park and The
Shining those are two great movies to
see those are two really cranberries to
see
oh man it's a great movies
I'm still opening them I don't think
they do anything I would get adorable
Dino drawing if they if it's our hazard
park
I agree it's portable way to all I don't
want it to be
but before being sensible
oh there's two enemies remaining
derp
shining is great
you should see the shining you should
see the shining used to be you should
see Jurassic Park Jurassic Park is just
the real deal
I've also made it to a difficulty level
where I can't rise anymore
and I kind of like that we've hit a
ridiculous point but there could be I
saw it you saw pizza trainees have Pulp
Fiction at 13 yeah that's a little too
young for pulp fiction maybe little too
young for Tarantino
Pulp Fiction has not aged well I wonder
I have not I mean I haven't seen her in
a long time I can only imagine that
still somewhat good someone to drive
like oats Tarantino has it aged better
or worse than Reservoir Dogs as I sell
risk for dogs recently and that that's
still great
who said that who said Buffington had
not aged well
oh you saw the camp oh my god I'm so
sorry yeah yes this is hoarders the game
risk of rain
hoarders the game
Reservoir Dogs is a better film than
Pulp Fiction I could believe that
like I don't want to just do I just kind
of want to keep going
should we do one more level and then the
end we'll try to get an even hundred
hours a hundred minutes trying to get a
hundred minutes we've already been at it
for an hour and 23 minutes and I can't
it can't get any more harder any more
harder I'm already at the most I'm
already at the worst difficulty level so
we'll just go one more one more level
you said that what who said what
yeah no you know pigs
Jack can you get more harder those
little goofy
ooh another jump one two three old
children
with all jongseo we have reached triple
jump
thanks for the exciting hey there's a
heat-resistant
I'm sorry Elizabeth
get out here with that
that a or that
shoot
drop a poison trap that little house
that sounds great I just want more yeah
that's one
it is like hoarders the game
I did see the new straight game playing
ad at the e3 PC showcase and I mean of
course I'm excited that level looked
great it looks like they've really been
working on it which of course is the big
question when it comes to any sort of
kick-started games like are you working
on it and it looks like they're doing
great it looks like they're making
exactly the game that promised to make
which I guess we shouldn't be like super
surprised at but but here we are
but here we are being super surprised
that they do the things that the plow is
to do look super fun kiss fire missiles
always appreciated
here
Yeah right here
right here
but yeah wave looked like I mean this
grave still looks like it's on a pond
it's basically the moral of the story
I mean it was just the worst
for worst magic
once I cure it's down there once we kill
him
piggy piggy we can deal with
after this we're gonna go we're gonna go
the others I swear
and I just dumped my heart to take more
she's a true
did anyone know what happened sounds
great
there's the bird dog who's a bird dog
I can play ringing oh man
I was also facing the wrong way
I want the lava take care you dear kids
okay all right for real now
well but one of my drones is over here
and I have planted drugs okay we are
gonna teleport now to the final level
I'm glad that my voice is soothing you
into a utopia harmony a solo Jack's
dream sounds dirty
okay you know what I haven't seen
Schindler's List either octo J I'm sorry
dancer in the dark is seriously great
you should go see a dancer
I couldn't go here and do it gently
final level plan a level go to the final
level
here we go
I have a triple jump that's so awesome
oh that's right the door is the stay
alive
you know here we go
I got a key card already
weird to think things
pease chance to freeze enemies yeah sure
I'll take a chance to free
Oh
dude
that's a good one again you like that
one
okay sorry risk free we are here
wait now
I'm III on the brand
I think everyone has a right
Oh
I was real bad kind of interested in the
PlayStation one because I thought they
actually showed that's about it
there's one other step
Oh
go up to where I was it's like magic
Queens up there now one
rich has been kidnapped rich has been
taken to the land of Chicago
to go see some sort of hockey parade
because a hockey team did well
so well that other people recognize that
yeah I'm gonna do a haka thing tomorrow
so he's not here
one
you are
to
colorful
ever
right here
week
okay
boxing-glove anything you oh you sneaky
bastard
how do I get to you oh I want you I
don't know I get to that one
Jack needs to do more damage I know my
damage is very low but I keep my damage
is low bada
my heels my heels I
so I have very good heels right now
which is
okay let's move on all right I'm done
here
oh you're quickly
enemies by falling I can do that now
I know what that is I should find out
what all these things
I just did something
I should sound like something I don't
know what
good
this is great just a couple enemies to
do it
just a couple enemies to do it
there's a reason
carefree and this is that right here
I don't even know like if you guys can
tell what it is I'm doing but I've been
just frantically running around and I'm
trying to stomp on the ground because I
got that thing where I used to stomp
damage and that's my that's my basic
strategy right now trying to kill the
big enemies 100 minutes made it to 100
minutes I think that's the longest I've
made it in risk of rain is over
we're gonna keep moving that's you
playing here oh I got the jet pack -
great you have a jet pack that's great
great
ukulele right his music was electric
okay great you can't tell me but Jake no
I know I really can like I cannot tell
what I'm doing I'm just facing the
things that I want to kill and hoping
that I hit them
and so far happened you know which is
nice
these scavengers ever a lot of Java guys
out
keep on like reviving my drones even
though I know I shouldn't
he's cost me money
yeah you know
okay no I know there's damn gran I gotta
get out of here I gotta get out of here
this is too much this is too much for me
to deal with I'm getting out of here
nope
yet not here okay
all right
I already think that killing an enemy I
already permanently increases my
it's not what we want that's not gonna
help us
Nathan
this
right
great
we just want all these things we just
want all these things
okay we're doing great we are doing
great I think scavenger there is
actually kind of difficult because it's
hard to know
104 minutes straight of risk of random
and I think that's great it get ice
104 minutes straight of any game is a
landmark risk of rain a little bit more
people need to look more controlled
there
okay I'll see if we can get that
scavenger
okay oh there's two of them now is it
time to kill one of these scavengers I
get more bonuses
and that's why that is very important to
me because I want all the stuff I can
get if I die and end up dying but it's
just not worth it and that's what it's
looking like somebody might not be worth
it
Larry
and all the key cards I'm getting all
these
we get into these rooms and I get all
this stuff I don't care about that
there's how there's that big chat then
you know you shouldn't have bought that
other chest because there's a big chest
over here okay we're going
okay now if that being chest
heaven cracker whoa I don't know what it
is but it sounds cool
another neat just worrying about
he'll-he'll I know that's all I'm
worried about every time I hit someone I
heal I can do more damage than nice okay
I get
I'm gonna run back and get out of here
okay you know
and everything
vo for a little bit
go down in here
Pete is getting all of the stuff
great I've always wanted whatõs
and all the key cards in American come
here get all this stuff and it just
makes the final boss that much easier
like we're even worried about the final
boss at this time
I'm certain doom probably right didn't
want to go down there doing
I can't what's down there why am I even
why are you being entertaining going
down there
got all my drone he's got some money
oh hey there's another big fight over
here I should probably take care of that
first the big fight Yeah right here
this big old daylight
I don't know what's going on you don't
know what's going on let's just pretend
like we can see what's happening in here
do you think you could end up in well it
all via I'll just let me say stuff this
happening to me no believe me it'll be
great
it'll all be great
did I get the thing that turns people
into ghosts
now be awesome
the ghost imp that fights for you
yeah
great stuff is happening is it I don't
everybody everybody
I'm just
we're doing it
there's another door there's another
door stay in here cuz I think in here
advantage
Stan like a coon
yourselves
how's everyone it's turned into a very
rich sellers band we're just not talking
that's what this
everything
I did get moving
the way it started
please the planet final boss final boss
time

has been so long since I played it but
hopefully we can remember
Wow

I forgot about the wormies this is a
great great great
great class when they're dying you're
dying about right
sighing about Olivia
ah possum snakes bossy snakes Boston
snakes
nobody'll do
wrong way to dingus
all right
you know I didn't
second form McGee over here
like no fight fine fine fine fine fine
I really like me the drones because he
can you can run away and still attack
and I think that's important to me
that's important to my strategy
Oh
Oh
running away is always key to my
strategy
Oh
I hate him with a gun he came with a gun
I know that's the deal station
shit shit shit
all right
here we go
here we go
there was 120 minutes of risk of rape
that's not great
good morning whoa I found I feel good
about that what do I think of Kingdom
Hearts I played the first one and I
thought it was crap I thought it was a
really interesting idea of kind of going
through the Disney worlds but I just
just did not care for it at all I really
I didn't like a combat I didn't like the
upgrade system I didn't like I did not
like the levels I promised a hentai game
next I don't know what do they make what
kind of games do they make and right
by a metal gear rising just as hard on
yourself entirely to disqualified myself
and tenderly to your little brother well
I'm sorry
you know what there were some type of
mirrors in tf2
lady can't lie today do that no square
the square enix makes Final Fantasy
seven they don't whatever stay I said
don't google it
oh well yeah I'm definitely not googling
it now definitely not now you goobers I
think y'all is a bunch of goobers

they might have
best summer beer recommendation is a
steagle rod ler it's a grapefruit juice
beer shot of gin some steagle radler
over ice is the best warm weather beer I
have ever ever had highly highly

the combat always felt sticky to me
gummy so you're a goober sir
don't play game I got installed Team
Fortress 2 so I don't have team fortress
2 going I did install a couple from my
Steam sale purchases that I was gonna
look into when you want a soda for beer
well that's why the shot of gin is
important because it's a low alcohol
beer steagle rattler but you get some
gin in there adds a little crispness
really nice one
why is this called risk of rain that's a
good question
okay so I got let's see here
I got la mulana in the in the summer

folks have been passing rumors down
about the secret treasures heck even the
origin of life itself may be hiding
inside these Rubens generation after
generation we've protected la mulana
even soul I don't really know what her
secrets are get out of town jack what I
won't stop you from entering the ruins
but mind you the mysterious the
mysteries of la-mulana are unsolved
because those who go in don't come back

actually control a reasonable degree
like what's happened just used to you
know when you're used to a controller
this I you know I'd like the sensitivity
to get a little better but what you used
to control it you need a controller okay
boom okay
but you know if you replace all the
cutesy items with I don't even know you

okay here we go
Oh what where where where where what
that's large what the floored okay we
have to beat this level at least this is
this is just a thing that has to happen
I feel okay okay I also like sales
they're very real pain anytime that my
character screams like that it's like a
visceral screams from right in my ears
I don't I don't know I don't know where
I'm supposed to go there one thing at a
time one problem that's what we're in
the other one fucking is it spice
there's a cherry bomb cherry bombs can't
touch the ground that's what's happening
before they touch the ground
spicy spikes am I gonna you shot my
dying this is important okay okay okay

well the Tonya that time I shall strike
for sure these sorry friends okay that's
what it was I was shooting too much of
this rent guy over here and accidentally
shooting my friend okay here we go I
beat you you know what this is
horrifying and I kind of love it
we're gonna do one more level one more
level and then we have to end this
because this is just too fucking weird
okay we just need to take a breather
we just need to take a breather we just
need to take a breather I'm gonna I'm
gonna hide behind this rock
it has ever thought about how much it
would cost to go to e3 if you have
thought about doing any interesting
conventions in you are there any we have
the Midwest gaming classic which is kind
of a it's a tabletop gaming convention
and uh like pinball thing that we keep
on to go to they also have like non
classic games but really no we don't
have like good conventions near
Milwaukee people told you this before
but you play some weird fucking games I
did you know what they have told me that
before and it's true they have told me
before and it's true this is a weird
weird game but this game that was
playing I don't need I don't even know
what I don't even know why outside of
the truth I got it on the stream sale
and and so just see what will just free
what the game is like doesn't matter I
was trying to one shot one kill
sniper feel like that sometimes the best
option is just to run blindly and you
can see what happens I didn't say oh I
didn't set off that one I didn't set off
that cherry bomb how did I not set up a
cherry bomb
boom Jesus Christ one or more horrible
what so we have some conventions around
here we're not necessarily interested in
going to e3 just because we find it to
be horrible just to just to watch III
let alone go you know maybe something
like like pax maybe something like pax
just cuz you see more games I think but
this is for reals II the end of the
stream we need to stop look at that bird
oh my god my friends are just staring at
me look at my friends he's staring at me
we need to stop lane stop it
