mornings edition of the little tribune
ooh don't pin the city we what was what
was up from the movie
we need more dope pushers and pimps need
mom pushes a bit recruit recruit love
tips maybe recruit more tips we did more
dope in the city recruit one pushes and
pimps ones beautiful peaceful quiet city
with few major crime problems is now
experiencing rapid growth and prosperity
but along with growth has come an alarm
innate increase in crime rate that is
what see page two oh okay wait smug
Ville USA president
Pecola was in smug Ville yesterday
evening observing the annual migration
oh right see don't feed oh you see that
I special see page two
oh okay there you go let's see here of
the writ Oh
let's switch sides for no good reason
that's really weird
learning a piece of Lytton police
sergeant john Dooley states that
dangerous drugs are showing up on the
streets and in our schools the homicide
rate on thee and prostitution oh I
thought the homicides prostitute
homicide rate and prostitution are at
level the city has never seen the
Tribune has learned from huh look
Burge continued from page one right of
the red-bellied swamp coddlers the
president who has been a bird lover
since childhood rich the baiting dance
of the cuddler as being as spectacular
as the golden crown scumsucker the
president can lee admitted that he was
skipped the geneva arms convention to
watch some old cobblers mate
the president says of bill is presently
before the Senate for cramming
proclaiming national cod lured a
reliable source that a big-time drug
deal with a street name of death angel
may be responsible for the drug traffic
oh that sounds like plot well so and
this is called police quest in pursuit
of the death a yes I'm assuming we need
to pursue the death angel
it's weird like as already there's a
comedic tone to the game yeah but we're
also pursuing street drugs named pusher
named FAA let's see how they totaled the
line they're gonna ride that line and
you wanna remind us you should read the
rest of this shit we should we should
let's see here I'll do escaped okay look
in the city jail reported the escape of
a female prison inmate last night oh
right
the officer of the Year nominees Litton
PD chief Whipple stick has nominated
Sonny bombs and Joe Florine foot Florine
flustered that's low that's the other
one I see a skimpy one oh Jesus bonds
and Walters Walters 4l PD officer of the
year war due to outstanding
effort and commitment and crime and
crime prevention and we're bonds right
we're some bonds yeah yeah yeah fucker
Lureen flustered flora Paxton flew the
coop by hiding beneath a pile of soil
prison laundry and a hand push basket
kingdom of Daventry I'll god they're
putting in a King's Quest reference you
know this quest game is now under siege
by a renegade three head and trackin one
identified gnome stated the kingdom is
in a state of emergency so what you're
saying is the quest games are in a
shared continuity universe
they shouldn't be they are they
shouldn't be but apparently they are
this this was well before the marvel
cinematic you a there's an easter egg in
space quest for your escape pod can
crash into king's quest that's great
hopefully we're the one hopefully were
the one with the glasses and mustache
that's what I'm hoping
cuz that guy is badass doesn't look like
we have glasses or almost just I want a
moustache I got here put down pepper
nose is your in that thought
Oh briefing is about oh we're here is it
you don't have time to relax take place
I don't eat it all right
I'll just find an empty chair see that's
got to be the guy with the moustache
they go this is yours oh hey what do you
know that you did it rich you did you
figured it out without even knowing oh
so that's the guy who's he's also up for
a nomination I'm going to assume as much
yeah he looks like he has guys is that a
mustache
that's a weird question from Hong Kong
rich how do you view world building in
games that's great what like that can
you be more specific on what you mean
very weird question yeah like it's good
when a game builds a world thief thief
built a great world yeah
the order well that they tried they had
a lot of good ideas their world wasn't
very fun I think we kind of dabbled on
that during the blood-borne episode was
just like just let us soak in the world
on our own you know yeah in police quest
we already kind of know it's gone
there's this president there's some
drugs there's a death angel I'm into
this world
alright alright Sergeant John Dooley
briefs the thirteen hundred shift
beginning with the latest hot sheet of
stolen rides yeah dog welcome back run
so sergeant Chantilly I hope you enjoyed
the long way round nice nice well what's
up he Burks we're looking for a black
1983 Cadillac I'm glad he's in 1983
cattle a license number LP one two three
eight GI n oh yeah you know what could
you get your handy dandy notebook of
doom the guy on C 0 3 4 5 6 - 1 8
they'll remember those numbers because I
said you will reported stolen last week
try hard to find it so I can get that
Malcolm Washington character off my back
for a change is C is that a 0 C 0 yeah
yeah there's a line across I'm assuming
that's a 0 the lop one is definitely old
because there's no line across 0 3 4 5 6
- 1 8 got it the little T's Eyre this
last night three teenagers were arrested
in three separate arrests each for drunk
driving two of the three were in
possession of cocaine
all three attend Jefferson High School
that should tell you something boys and
girls sure write down Jefferson the
high-school drug drought and I probably
won't come on but uh but they were on
possession of cocaine
oh we are going to be in search of the
death angel who I'm assuming sells
cocaine maybe we should just check out
Jefferson High at some point I don't
remember I mean almost any of the
solutions in this game go so I made a
note of Jefferson High School I'm
something of a blank slate
sure well that's it for today watch your
Bucs kids we don't want old chief
Whipple stick lying about our industrial
injury injury stats going up again
Sonny bombs your call number will be 83
- 32 83 - I'm telling you specifically
even though the whole room is full of
people goodbye yeah my briefings over ah
Red Dog Gold team ah wants to know if we
like hidden meanings in movies or do you
prefer the film to lay out its meaning
slash attention for you but I felt fine
choices I think is a dumb question I'll
judge these things I guess in a case by
case basis I don't know right it's
always fun to kind of discuss the head
meetings and movies and you know if
they're clever about it it doesn't
really matter but yeah movie that's a
cubbyhole right they called it something
pigeon pigeon hole ooh
Sonny how's about at 1198 on 1198 at
carols caffeine castle later in the
shift oh wait we have to look up the
manual here
they had different cult members for some
for some a 1198 it's like coffee break
or something sure what is it 1198 I have
the manual in front oh come here okay
1198 is a meeting okay 1198 Carole's
coffee castle
Carroll's coffee castle got it okay rich
you have a strict worldview you're more
of a shoot from the chip kind of doofus
I having a dog ma so I guess I'm shoot
from there we all do what we can
yeah we all do we can the important
thing you know even if you have a strong
worldview is to be open to new ideas and
change them when new evidence is
presented Pluto is no younger planet
yeah
and that's an okay thing oh now now
we're in the chief sauce oh shit get out
of there

in there she Knicks I'm gonna go out on
a limb here I know this is very
important to you I'm gonna say there are
no spikes in this video game I think
it's a fair assumption we probably need
a gunman
I mean we do inventory as keys the
newspaper and the radio extender and
what assume guns are needed yeah we good
take off pants shit oh I'm not reading
that oh oh say foo back out of here just
to shade you getting close enough to
dance with and Lord all the knows I did
enough dancing last night is that Allah
is that a lady or man uh men okay it's a
men's locker room okay
listen man listen hey fool big I got it
here just a shade you getting close
enough to dance with and load on the
nose
I did not dancing last night you're
right that's that's the voice that's the
voice oh look there's somebody in the
can we'll talk to him hmm open door oh
my god a Michelle I don't know if that's
casual racism or just stereo I like
stereotyping yeah it necessarily racism
obviously they made a stereotypical
character I'm just going along with with
the theme the Luton PD locker room has 2
rows of full-size double stack lockers
with a bench between them two showers
and three toilet stalls where's my
locker
Oh Oh God
all right personal gear you see your
weapon in your gun belt there is a speed
loader of ammunition on the shelf
great your briefcase rest on the bottom
of the Locker great keys your Corvette
are hanging on a hook how do you pop a
word on that world the take your we're
gotta be on the tape we know that's
great that mean if you were have to take
and then you got like you got to choose
what bribe you took from what mobster if
we're a cop writing please simulator
yeah
yeah we are we are on someone's payroll
that's not the delay met dee dee get gun
belt
yep it's be loader yeah 20 G's take gun
pull back hammer shy get the brief shoot
self and head you suppose there's
anything I need in the briefcase maybe
look in briefcase phase vams okay I will
oh shit there you go I'm going to assume
I don't need the Corvette's
press X to accept cash bribe absolutely
by the way if we get offered a bribe a
fucker taken and I got a Corvette papers
loaned gun alright weapon is loaded whoa
that may have come did bite us later we
pull out our gun and click click click
yeah but what if someone takes their gun
what if someone steals our gun if it's
loaded hey no I think most cops don't
carry briefcases when they're out on
patrol but also we're not carrying a
briefcase now because it's a video game
I'm AB denied oh shit how could you do
it no we're not committing suicide today
that's right be cool about firearm
safety but I'll so you know we need to
make sure our gun is loaded right I hope
I don't have to like equip the belt or
something I think I hope it's okay just
in my inventory I put bailed on their
wear belt I'm gonna assume it
automatically yes now this is this is a
puzzle I remember you have to inspect
your vehicle before you get into it
you're through inspected all sides
yeah if you don't you drive you you pull
out and then car like explodes game over
do you find a bomb no it's just you have
to check the car before you go out I
wonder if that's in the manual your mark
patrol car features a powerful v8 engine
choked down with the very latest in smog
devices and purchased from the lowest
bidder it is capable of attaining speeds
of up to 87 or motton or more miles per
hour
Wow so you can kind of can go back in
time in it that's quicker yeah well no
you can't right because if they go 88
miles per hour or over but apparently
the low is 87 Oh 87 or bucks which one
is mine
there's like six cars which one is mine
let's see here
handcuff procedures personal hygiene
Percy I'm reading the manual right now
yeah I'm seeing if there's something
about inspecting your car check car
there's got to be that killed me as a
kid I needed to use this year our
helpline to solve that one because they
actually had an 800 number you called

great you observe a group of bystanders
gawking at a green sedan that attempted
to carve its own door in the side of a
brick building okay alright get out of
the car
oh my god oh this is exciting this is
great why they're crash percent Oh like
procedures we need to do oh yeah there
are crash procedures hold on hold on oh
wow I love this game a lot of manual
looking up here driving codes
intoxicated driver procedures felony
traffic stop procedures routine traffic
stop producers when a violation has been
witnesses stop the violator as quickly
as possible so no there's nothing about
crash procedures it says detect possible
intoxication by observing erratic
driving you know being a highly trained
observer you immediately notice a
smashed coupe on the sidewalk in a crowd
of rubber necker's milling around nearby
the crowd includes one particularly
anxious young man oh look at car this
man slumped over the steering wheel look
at man okay closer you take in you take
a deep breath look in the car and see a
male slump motionless over the steering
wheel
oh no a closer look reveals a bloody
injury to the left side of his head
and a gaping hole in his lower right jaw
oh God we we have a possible homicide
oh and I don't want the death either the
building no I'm not exactly what I want
look a face hole
that's a job for the corner
well they said one of the men of letter
was anxious yep get over there
Jesus Christ this is exciting this is
great rich you sure you don't want to be
in the controls no no I like you at the
controls or else everyone's gonna make
fun of my typing again little old lady
in the crowd cries out officer do
something that man is hurt bad to help
him okay Dwight's gonna use a radio to :
oh um let's see here radio codes use
radio you have nothing to report
investigate the accident scene see if
you can discover something oh okay um
talk to men a little old lady in the
crowd just like yeah yeah yeah ray the
the there's a Cody 1141 for an ambulance
that's not gonna do much good now oh
shoot matted leg right look at young man
which one is the young man sighs only
bright like I don't yeah he's balding he
can't be young the blonde one
I'm assuming when I say man it goes
automatically to be yeah the guy in the
car
fuck you what does it say look around
you immediately notice the smashed coupe
on the sidewalk and a crowd of rubber
necker's milling around nearby the crowd
includes one particularly anxious young
man Todd talk what about talk to young
man lowly come on now you're the jerk
gets to there you go Oh
first of all it's a nightstick oh yeah
that's right
no no I'm good I merged it with billy
club get um get I think you'd like now
that you're right in front of them say
talk to young man you're kind of in
front of that lady so
nope all right maybe I have to do more
at the car first
did it say something about the
windshield yeah well I can see it looks
like this hole yeah
just below the broken glass of the
driver's window has a strange pattern
for a car wreck it appears to be a
bullet hole dum-dum dawn GW and examine
glass see nothing special examine hole
and then it's just the day yeah yeah oh
yeah you're right take off pants I think
that would help in this situation the
man's dead with a gunshot wound right
yeah it's a pole stuff fuck is there the
bricks won't have uh
oh yeah maybe look for bullet all right
all right well it's probably in his head
sure that's uh but that's a hometown
markup that was thank you for that
suggestion uh okay so we shouldn't take
suggestions because they know they need
the game the guides and spoilers
oh but by the way you're looking at your
own gun oh so I think that was a genuine
thought okay well that's good then I'm
sorry for accusing you of things that
you didn't do because that's a horrible
thing maybe can you like check the crowd
for like a gun bulge ask about accidents
how can you do that
and you can't radio for an ambulance
well you probably have to find that
fucking old lady's to shut up we want to
talk to the young man how do we talk to
the young man each radio nothing to
report
I have gunshot to report how's that some
people are suggesting you check the
trunk I was just actually just about to
do that okay and other people are
suggesting you you look in your
briefcase oh that's not a bad suggestion
now okay which a briefcase yes I don't
know later the yeah mister glitch as you
see we've been trying to look at our
briefcase and it's not letting us do
that once some I saw someone say like
can we try to radio for help as soon as
it says that's a job for the corner like
maybe like the corner is is the trigger
hey alright alright it's probably more
we need to do the body yes and real no
pulse no breathing no vital signs there
is a bullet hole driver's window this is
not your normal traffic a normal
everyday traffic accident in your
opinion this man was murdered
yes okay well we know that's new text

out on our own which I know could be
frustrating for you guys sometimes but
this is the fun of the game okay window

new text okay there you go

sunburned on my head and a ton of people
were out walking in the neighborhood
today and the stupid hat shop was closed
said well how can you how can you be

I want a fedora like I was gonna look at
trail B's just cuz they have brims this
is not I mean you know like a fedora for
anyone who doesn't know this is the
advantage owns hat

real estate I don't know if it'd look
good for me but I was looking at trail
B's look at Epidaurus
or else I'm just gonna say fucking wear
a baseball cap if I could get away with
it I'd wear like one of those like
Arabian night like not a turban thing
but just like the thing that covers your
head and drapes over the back of your
neck neck but I can't get away with that
because I would look ridiculous if I
could get away with it I would get a
fucking parasol I wear a parasol or walk
around with a parasol every day but I
can't yeah in any case hey Dad

professional conduct in most cases this
will prevent the situation from
escalating be refrained from abusive
language or threats it will only
escalate the situation level two

alright
and and I might have to go backhand J
and Mike for another reason anyone who
watched our Avengers episode yeah might
have noticed a little something missing
from the fucking credits oh really like
you know someone who was in the episode
might not have been credited in the end
of the in the avengers episode okay
you're gonna love the one that just did
from that max where they start off the
episode by insulting us he went the foul
on a bald one you know what that was
funny
yeah but uh they forgot my credit in the
avengers episode
it's Jay's fault I talked to Jay about
it we will not be talking about
fury road for one I don't think jack is
seated and Jack is wrong tonight I've
seen it for another one I don't want I
don't want to spoilers I'm just gonna
say it's it's fucking amazing the movies
fucking amazing it's the best time I've
had watching a movie in forever and a
day yeah yes yeah it's some good shit
what oh I was just looking someone asked
where my mic was and it looks like my
level is weird you didn't touch that at
all no okay I'm here okay respond to a
complaint at Kara Oh Carole's caffeine
castle great place comes up a lot I did
think making fun of us in the newest
half of the bag was very funny
I was accredited for the Avengers up so
Jay just copy and pasted the credits
from the previous episode not thinking
to add me to it this is also not the
first time they've left me out of the
credits of an episode but you know what
it's fine everything's fine everything's
fine I backhanded the Jay I'm rich
crashed his please just say I need to be
a bit more generous in driving
yeah Jay you're a J copy and pasted the
credits which happens when you're when
you're trying to do things quickly and
he feels really bad about it and I made
him feel bad about it for for a while
before saying he was okay but Jay also
left me out of the credits for the
episode where I was mailman Tommy and
I've never forgiven him for that as that
was an acting role
you know like when he opens the door
gets out of the car I really want to see
her a Robocop game done in the style
Sierra's the sound effects could be a
little clump when you walk a striker I
agree with that
Avengers being kind of mid tier Marvel
Cinematic Universe link entertaining but
yeah overall it'll it's it's a bridge
it's not the climax it's a bridge it's
fine if you're into the cinematic
universe it's a fine addition but but
yeah it's not it's not what the first
ventures was oh oh sunny those drunken
bikers in the bar next door taken up all
the parking really taking all the
parking places they're part of my cafe
they just have no consideration for
others where my customers gonna park
would you ask them to move their
motorcycles please great another chapter
in your life of big-time crime stopping
parking space Hawking honestly why is
she so upset about this I've radioed in
do you have your nightstick with you yes
I'm pretty sure I can grab that out of
the car double-check why so many in the
chat single going do you need it no I'm
looking up the levels of enforcement
level twos head-to-head combat okay
and it says you might have to use your
nightstick so level one is what this is
gonna come up these guys aren't gonna
want to move their bikes we know this
use firm Professional Conduct in most
cases this will prevent the situation
from escalating refrain from abusive
language or threats okay level 2a
suspects threat indicates imminent
physical attacked no weapons visible
call for backup unit if possible use
Department approved hand-to-hand combat
if appropriate used PR 24 nightstick
okay level three deadly force we won't
get
yeah probably not probably as he heads
for the back room the bartender mumbles
under his breath here comes trouble
oh the we are so hand-to-hand combat
lots of blood sweat and tears and other
things have been deposited in wino
willies leader or this bunch comes over
you and says well well if it ain't the
tidy-bowl man
well well if it ain't the chattable man
go there you go
what the bleep do you want Bianca oh
shit dog
asked to tell firm voice right firm
professional conduct man - wolf bike
what's the total all right ask man to
move Miz no bike bike talk to man the
animal in the black leather jacket says
we don't talk to no pigs I think we
should go with leftover beefcake
suggestion of Dead or Alive you're
coming with me
this ain't the kind of place would do
good as chump man top no pants ready of
a backup if non-compliant let's see here
person shows okay level one the firm
Professional Conduct a person shows
passive verbal resistance usually under
routine slaps do use firm professional
comic oh we do look at girl wait say the
kind of lizard yeah you said very look
at girl oh nothing special
well we did just pull over that hottie
in the question she's probably looking
look at her look at those friends you
can't really tell but she's probably all
saggy yep
in the back of a motorcycle probably at
15 she's done that she's done nothing
but like smoke for the last 30 years all
you're seeing is the flaps of leathery
clear alright how do we resolve this
take the darts away you want to take the
toys away
I mean they're playing darts not
listening to you let's see here we don't
tie he's just saying we don't talk to no
pigs right yeah it's like I think you
need to get in the way of their game
might get again there it's retarded I'm
gonna die when the dart hits me well
save
though
okay I mean so you're right but you save
you have been nailed by a four grimdark
tossed by a 250 pound biker good job
next time watch where you're walking
okay so I'm going right to the
nightstick yeah Eric off Rebecca yep yep
so you did that yep okay get out a
nightstick yeah let's fuck him up just
do that yourself okay
because we're not listening to you
oh wow where's handcuff procedure I
think we're at a handcuffed procedure
yet we need to get him talking demand
compliance don't what's the demand what
man are you talking do Batman by her
head drink well no you can't do that
god the server in a real world we just
beat the shit out of this man right he's
coming right for me living shit
type in he's coming right for me okay
someone has a good suggestions which is
a go outside and check search their bike
sounds that sounds fine that's a
reasonable thing did you radio for
backup
yeah okay I mean in this safe I did that
when I walked in okay sorry
oh you died October bikes I can't be
good
no no your yeah I mean you're fucking
dead or is that what you're supposed to
do I doubt it
and now you can fight him maybe maybe
here we go here we go
it's happening it's all happening Todd
and bold man it's hell
what's the tale see here let's see what
we got here
let's see let's say let's try well
should I go I'm do the bike knocking
over can you wonder they're not back no
vibra strong again Oh move bikes
can you just say move bikes hold up hold
up
I thought the gun is the solution I know
I can draw the gun but I doubt we're

illegally Oh
Oh No run plates how do that inspect
plates fun because we there's a
motorcycle missing Oh check the VIN
numbers yeah my momma yeah momma
what's a yeah my mom no just bad news no
no all right all right
read plates was read
no no all right now this
set fire to bikes I don't think I don't
think that would help I think I think I
like the suggestion of just telling you
know like get darts oh god he's still
shooting oh wait wait
the best way to play darts is to save
your game turn off your computer and buy
a dart board maybe you'll get to play
darts in please cause - oh I think so
much to play deterrents
I just want to interrupt their game yeah
I think that's the smart an idea that's
why I wanted you again there I talk to
the bartender bartender win him back
type in move bikes Steve was he gonna do
physically move all four bicycles no no
I mean go up to the man and Oh cuz
that's a firm way instead of asking him
to move bikes you just say move bikes
okay
just see if that works dynamo man him I
like that I like that
how'd he plan on making us yeah good
work jack good well that wasn't me that

intoxicated driver procedures one detect
possible intoxication by observing
erratic driving
- after stopping the suspect to
determine his condition by determining
the the odor of alcoholic beverage
administering a FST field sobriety tests
on Jay you question the approach the
vehicle is there one male seated behind

registration in the name of art
Caribbean okay whose record check shows

McIntosh Street restrictions programmer
to get it I don't get it right tickets
no no we need a field sobriety test how
do we do this it says we need to detect
the odor of alcoholic beverage sniff
smell a car smell a car yeah

an alcoholic beverage a now we need to
give FST FST yeah you can't do that with

sobriety test you quickly administer the
field sobriety test and our amused as
your subject gives his best imitation of
a young swab tempting its first take off
by the book what's next so now we need
to arrest him right Kaufmann read man
read man writes first we handcuff and
search suspect the drunk begs you could
you cuff me in front please I'm not
feeling so good nope nope male suspects
must be handcuffed behind the back not
whining sick a chance you explain I'm
sorry sir but departmental policy
dictates all custody arrests shall be
restrained by proper handcuffing
procedure and that means behind your
back women suspects may be handcuffed in
front at your discretion
really yeah that's what it says
interesting you place your shut your
subject under arrest for the violation
of Lippmann's City vehicle code VC two
three five zero two driving while under
the influence
search suspect man pat-down the
gentlemen and find no weapons now read
man his rights all right carefully
admonish your suspect of his Miranda
rights to abridge remain silent what'd
you say it may be used against you in
the court of law you have the right to
an attorney if you cannot afford an
attorney one will be appointed to
represent you before questioning if you
wish nice yeah nice yeah it's here any
instructions I don't know I guess we're
gonna get
the car so take man to car
reluctantly he says okay where are we
going
so not so it's not to excite him you say
oh we're just going to take a little
ride to see some friends of yours it's
okay buddy come on
oh what a nice guy oh look it's got a
little head bobble suppose he can't open
the door on his father not open the back
door open the door oh that's where
you're standing I suppose OOP don't
forget to close the door us it'll roll
right out the cover in front you suppose
he chokes you on the road I mean maybe
her like try to escape and her yeah I do
wonder what's gonna happen but we're
going by the fucking book here all right
we did it rich
Oh God where do we take this guy to the
J Oh to the jail I know where the jail
is where's the jail who takes that car I
mean you use radio
oh yeah use radio that's a good idea
isn't somebody had to pick up the car
radio for tow truck I don't know nothing
said something about that what about my
car oh here we go
don't worry it'll be toned somewhere
safe in your expense right the jails way
at the bottom Oh save yes yes jails way
at the bottom 7th streets and River Road
which is the bottom road bottom like I
just along the bottom sent along the
bottom you know like the the last row
find it we'll find it the bottom road is
real open yeah it down even one more oh
god oh god oh god nice
I got eyes I got eyes it's that one
there is that one that big building I
never yep it's that big brick building
that's the jail cuz he probably have to
take him to the jail I can only assume
right well yeah the station didn't seem
like I had once alright yep City Jail
her already take him to the courthouse
usually I do
cuz there's the courthouse is right next
door hold on that's gotta be the channel
I mean well tell me to fuck off I guess
right let's see here look at
because the police station that did not
have like the facilities oh yeah here it
is Reid suspects his rights transport
prisoner to jail jail okay look around
II was the officers booking entrance to
the living city jail the exercise yard a
prisoner dribbles continuously he also
bosses is basketball oh that's right and
see that's racist
that's not stereotyping that's just
racist what is this look at Walker what
are those these lockers are used to
store officers weapons while they're
inside the jail on business how they go
that seems insane what if what if
somebody breaks out in like the jail
well it's in the locker it's locked in
the locker it better than that have them
take off take your weapon off you in a
jail I guess see Manos fate hands rich
feels the same way and I'm with rich
that typing is better than pointing and
clicking I also prefer typing it seems
to you use you know use a different part
of your brain yeah when you have to type
it out yeah it seems it seems more
natural it's it seems like more useful
think outside of the box rather than
just click on things looking at what you
what what can interact with yeah click
on does this interact with that notice
in Iraq no does this interact with no
yeah think about what you're doing and
why you're doing it which is what's
great about the Sierra game its what's
great about text event there's angry dog
I know I was trying to put away the
nightstick it said it had to go in the
car Oh does it well I might be okay to
bring the nightstick inside let me talk
to the guys at the door first
you had that one as I'm assuming there's
a buzzer looks like a buzzer by the door
look at look at look at ya and that's
right Johnny beam no ho like in a point
and click game you can just like
randomly click on the screen until
eventually you click on something that's
click honorable you know here you add
the prisoner it's all in your mind yes
with a sex adventure yes there's no
there's no cheating the system yes
which i think is wonderful we I do talk

people at that stream because I tweeted
that I was testing with our previously
recorded Twitter and some people showed
up there were people watching and I was
chatting with them we did it
but but I'll save this I'll save this as
a unknown trivia question we don't want
to okay we don't want to give this away
this is this will be valid trivia
question if someone can figure it out we
almost Chippendales for us two Rangers

extra copies all the time I mean I
forgot about that game I probably lied
to you why yes I'm a compulsive liar

us you're right that was the first game
I've ever not Pokemon okay so we got the
drunk driver
mmm-hmm it was not hard driving I don't
know what that is that's a neat little
driving game actually
oh I think it's the exact same game as
stunts and stunts is a great game where
you can make your own courses in 3d and
drive them around oh cool as crash cars
I'm trying to think of an appropriate
hint well don't give a hint if it's
gonna be a trivia thing down the road

is so oh here's a fork okay here 24 is
the nightstick right I suppose

trying to do a Google search for the
first game stream down this channel to

moment
I'm searching
it's getting very quiet in here
my god these people are all following me
oh my god
they are are you talking to them her I
don't know no look at Dooley the van has
gone berserk
I thought that new desk decoration was
rather comical what I don't know honey
you should have seen sergeant Dooley
when he first discovered that chicken he
threw screaming fit and wanted the
lieutenant to dust for prints what
somebody's probably played a prank oh oh
okay take a look in my office scene
maybe you can shed some light as to how
that creature made his way to the top of
my desk
ah yes oh my god oh my god you can
hardly believe your eyes a full-grown
chicken with its legs tied together is
flapping about and clucking raucously
right on sir Julie's desk brothers fly
everywhere but that's not the worst
unfortunately the chicken has lost
control of her bodily functions that the
mysterious gremlin has truck sergeant
Dooley again
sunny if I find out you are that
inconsiderate worthless gremlin I'll
hang you out to dry look at that chicken
okay here's a couple of you have figured
it out
I played a plug-and-play amazing
spider-man game it's one of those like
ten dollar games that you can buy at
Walmart that plugs there is a controller
that plugs directly into your TV and
it's called the amazing spider-man they
figured it out through my Twitter so yes
it was the amazing spider-man plug-in
play controller game that was the very
first game stream to this channel we
might have to play it again you know
yeah to me to make the circle complete
it's actually like I mean it's it's it's
not a great game but it's shockingly for
just being one of those plug-in plays is
pretty good it was amazing
oh yeah you didn't think to like I my
hahaha draw gun shoot chicken I just
thinking about it
wait do you have to get the chicken off
his desk I mean it's close to midnight
yeah save it at the chicken draw gun you
know

procedures and your LPD please VA's
indoctrination guide okay so you
probably can't you can only use deadly
force in self-defense
