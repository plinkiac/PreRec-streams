roommate whoever it was at the time

location damage oh yeah
red spots yeah is uh someone wants to

in Jack when we telling you guys no just
me and Jack yeah this this is this is
what it took to get me in here and I
remember I remember jack and I talking
about this when you were talking about
just just before the first pilot and
getting it all set up and like you know
if you guys bust it down to like Atari
games or vintage arcade games I'm there
um but this is about as far as I went I
am NOT the video game person left on one
second dictor birthday boy no no mustard
is terrible know what I hate mustard
what mustard is although mustard is
fantastic mustard makes me want to throw
up oh come on he's making a joke dude a
PC I know yeah I know I don't like the
comparison no offended haha my mustard
your friend if I must you angry about
mustard I foul
I I would say there's things foods I
dislike yeah muster times I would
actually say I despise Wow
you guys you hear it here first Wow rich
to spy system like not even I'd like do
you like do you like brats like hot
mustard out of back I don't like it
anything like it look like I like one Oh
like a grand jurors know a grainy spicy
mustard here's here's a sec my
girlfriend
she she insisted that I just never had
good mustard right
could you show you are these I could are
you know there's no one years and years
ago she took like it's like literally a
drop of Grey Poupon
tip of a spoon to try this uh-huh I
tried it i gagged for five fucking
minutes
Wow are you allergic to mustard no I
just despise it it's awful okay listen I
just flies mustard I'm very sorry I I
don't like pickles and I don't think
ketchup deserves of anywhere new cheese
so that's why I just Everman I don't
Mike you forgot plain just because it's
easier yeah because we've talked about
that where it's also allows you to get
if you're doing like a fast-food burger
get to your pressure burger no sure cuz
it's not you know the kidding ham
they don't make it like that I you know
what I prefer on my fast-food burgers is
mom mustard and onions only like no
ketchup I'm not a big fan of kit but and
I know guys this is a really interesting
topic seriously controversy so make sure
to LIKE subscribe but I vote the mustard
conversation yes please we're traveling
with your mustardy opinions they're
bridge ends he of the shitty opinion oh
fuck you yeah
okay I know I got an audience and you
don't take your fucking the mustard love
else well I just don't I never
understood ketchup so anger sugarpaste
no it's not it's intuitive it is it is
tomato and vinegar based with you in
some sugar and some salt
yeah actually this solves more burden
than the sugar because there's a natural
sweetness in tomatoes but catch is not
ketchup is reserved for unusually bland
french fries Wow that's the only time I
ever got ketchup dick the birthday boy
has a really good question will there be
any gaming in this condiment stream
mouth well the only way that got me here
was the promise that we wouldn't
actually play in a game that we were
just talking about condiments I actually
had I had I was exposing my opinion on
a1 sauce on my Twitter earlier this week
I actually was what's your name buddy I
love a 1 sauce but I also like a good
steak yeah and they want to you know if
you put a 1 on a good steak you're
wasting it absolutely so it's just like
I don't want to get bad steak and then
but I like a 1 and it's a conundrum
this was my problem with any sort of
steak sauce is why because steak sauce
is there to cover up a bad steak and so
just why have a bad steak in first place
you're listening to condiment toys NPR
yeah um but I honestly like the taste of
a1 sauce I don't think it's spoiling
anything to say that Jesse puts on her
eggs she does and that blew my mind well
fucking bed what yep very we were having
dinner out I can't remember is me
investing Jamie I can't remember a 1
sauce on your egg a one sauce and hot
sauce you know you know what's in your
most delicious
dad delicious sour cream on fries sour
cream on fries yeah Sam we're good but I
think again a bit sour cream on a lot of
baked potato you put sour cream on
pierogies so guess what sour cream and
fries that goes together like like like
like like playing a game Oh uh-oh are we
doing the single-player first or what

nonstop ten minutes non-stop ten minutes

ass I'm asking to do this is awful oh I
guess what I mean is this is my new
favorite game I'm done yeah all right

glass okay are you guys this is the
ugliest game this is via in the world
look at these walls
everybody is there one good-looking game
on the Nintendo 64 one no idea played
like two games on this ever and we have
them both named na straight straight and
coming back and straight that's hey I'm
good that's all I'm doing straining oh
fuck my plan my first plan didn't work I
you're playing this for shit jack ha ha
ha oh yeah we will definitely do a
rocket-launcher turn oh sure
this is just all right is there a button
to run ah you just push you push up
quickly
and it doesn't really push forward more
yeah but if you push it all the way up a
little move a little faster oh no that's
not me
I'm quite efficient - can't hit you can
good happen
ah the one thing I'm really not gaining
back that I used to have is a sense of
where I am and I used to know these oh
yeah I used to know this stuff well
enough to have an idea just like okay so
I go here and then I go to this thing
and nope oh yeah I mean I remember
memorizing all of the little bullet like
all the weapon drops getting up to the
other levels one level can't you I go to
grace
I think don't go to hallway it's easy
money
come here clear no karate chappie why
are you down my car dumped you like
eight times
yah-hoo apathetic one says the n64 had
one of the weakest libraries of any
console
maybe yeah just barely huh yeah maybe I
don't know it was you
considered to be a good game like I know
it's good shit something that controls
well I think would be my definition of a
good game well like it's getting some
shit lately but I still like ocarina and
I still like Mario 64 was a good game
I'm exactly as sin but it's a good game
ah smash brothers starfox motherfucks
starfox starfox I remember starfox
looking good Star Fox 64 is brilliant
game feel like I'm steering a bulldozer
our ice Rick ah
oh wait I remember something
like a name Duane's better it's gonna be
you you hit me running away
oh no that's really stupid I wasn't a
karate champion you can't do it oh
that's dumb that I really hit that
that's just Tom what do you even Presta
crunch ow
uh oh you press the a button to get rid
of your weapon yeah if not have anything
in your hands and then you're present in
your on your Friday job which is useful
knowledge when we do slappers only which
we will have to do as that it's fucking
fun

night mr. Rai - thank you so much for
coming out
okay so that's a plain old regular
regular stylee so now let's start
fucking around
um yes John Kela we would describe this
drive these controls as awkward hopeful
quite see the awkward supercut yes it's
meant a second um you only live twice as
something you died twice and you're done
the man with the Golden Gun is the one
that if you get the Golden Gun you can
kill anybody instantly license to kill
is any hit is fatal and so the fun thing
there is to do license to kill with
slappers let's definitely do that
and try that yeah let's do that let's do
license to kill with slappers only and
then we'll do do rocket launchers next
okay I pick different level sure
on their proximity mines and all sorts
of things you haven't fucked around with
you hey don't be shitting on the
gamecube gamecube we've had some are we
all still comfortable with our
characters ah Elvis delvis um we have
emoticons you get to use them
oh nothing doesn't look it up I forget
how you do it but you have to type in a
thing and then you type in another thing
you're good it gives you more account

a real game now
hunker resin we don't have real games

your opinion is this game uglier than
doom
yes and I've ad month I love the sprites
in Douma you hate doom no you know what
I love the sprites but it's an ugly game
like though all the walls are brown and
the floors orange animus primal I will
sign your poster but did you order it
already
um how many months of attended not many
thanks I'm here there's something in
that it needs to be signed oh sorry
oh there might be it oh there is opposed
to them okay this is the first time Josh

oh sorry what is it possibly I was
reading good for the jam ah okay uh I
don't wanna do proximity mines why don't
owe her yeah I'll do proximity mine and
then we can move on so have you played
any of the source port some do know
didn't people people update that game
yeah I like fans yeah Oh every I like I
like the source engine I'm familiar with
the source engine so
I know there's one called doomsday that
prettied it up a bit
okay I'm gonna switch you know I won
that last one so I'm gonna be James Bond
now sure okay yeah I'm gonna be Myshkin
I don't even remember who Michigan
wanted so say he was the Russian wasn't
me I don't fucking know the name like
that he probably was sure I guess
okay so you gotta go yeah what when we
play now uh proximity buying oh I did I
did look into adding smirking Jesus as a
motor motor come on uh it's too it's too
complicated you guys we're gonna get it
I'm gonna add a new face and a buck on
we're still playing the best father here
yeah and Jack is in the top right corner
josh is in the top left corner riches in
the bottom of fuck pine tar no odd job I
think that's what we'll do next is we'll
just play a little bit of the
single-player mission to unlock ah yeah
oh sure
do we need to win the whole game to
unlock on job I don't remember I don't
this is just a scan of his eye he's
short and that that can be that can
definitely be an advantage ah
and especially for slackers on my also
think we should check
we might be if there might be because
this game had been played before we
might have a different level where odd
job has been unlocked oh yeah let's
check that kill streak - you haven't
killed chica - yeah - true
troopers the trooper the trooper trooper
luck you did you were nominee wasn't you

want to I want to do it right that a sec
little episode I love him so much
dad I like doing yoga we haven't seen I
like that but now that one's too good
rich and I know I know and the thing is
we also have a lot of Steckler movies
that we haven't seen and he was very
prolific oh there any kind of health
packs this game does it reaches bot just
the body over buddy I'm we're kind of
acts like a fact when you get hit
there's the blue bar and the AH and the
red bar the blue bar is your armor and
the red bar is your health the red bar
only goes down if the blue bar goes so
theoretically
you could have
keep getting dryer
I'll finally killed someone almost I
didn't I did it this is oh this is so
ugly casual bridge wants a whole pack

Jack: Oh, should we talk about that...Josh?
Josh: Hm?
Jack: Should we talk about...
Josh: Oh...yeah. I mean, I have a, I have a nickname. It's Wizard. It's, it's not that exciting a story. I've just had it for a really long time.
Jack: People have asked us in the stream before. And our answer is always, because he's a wizard.
Josh: Yeah.
Jack: And so, but we, I, I don't know why you're called The Wizard. I just call you Josh, cuz...
Josh: It's okay. It's just a nickname that I've had for a really long time that just was, you know, something that stuck with me. I don't really give a shit about explaining where it came from, cuz the story's not that great. It's not that exciting. It's not gonna be, like, aha, now I know it. It's, you're gonna know it, and then that's it. Like, it's not fun. Um, it's fun if you know the people that are involved, and I promise, you don't. So, it's not that exciting, so just accept that it's a nickname I have. It's not a big deal, and don't worry about it.
Jack: There you go.
Josh: And it's a nickname I still use because people repeatedly call me it.
name at the gaya Shannon branch
um Josh where did you get that robot
capturing oh uh that we actually oh here
we go oh here we go oh forgot some odd
jobs and some jobs and stuff some stuff
uh we actually actually had that made um
there wait we had the design Chloe her
friend Chloe made that design and I
thought it was really good and I know
I'm not a virgin you idiots um I had her
send that to me and then I had a friend
of mine in Detroit
who's a really good guy who's uh oh god
I'm gonna have to think of this company
I feel that it's a wizard because he
made it magically made his virginity
disappear into a vagina Wow
ha ha ha that's right
I made my virginity disappear into a
Virginia he waved his magic wand over
and over again and then and then
something appeared I'm sorry that's way
better than my women in the actual story
so I'm not rolling with it it's good
anyway we only made 10 of them um so
it's not anything that you can purchase
anywhere it's a special fun thing that
we have then right we get to lord over
you I guess very few people have the
special fun teacher here because we're
part of a cool Club and it's the club is
called the cool the cool people calm
private I've I've had to yes I got I got
the shirt right and I had foolishly
worked the studio yeah and I was
painting something in back and I just
just real quick I didn't realize and I
the can pointed the wrong way I just
picked up ah just that I was just gonna
give some a quick spurt and I sprayed it
right on the shirt and you can media
farcical II sprayed yourself with a
backwards yes yes just thinking about
the the physical comedy of that affected
if it was a bit that was filmed it would
have been very ever happy honey but as
it turned out I had another shirt being
Richard sighs so marriage has it and
everything's hunky-dory again um yes
it's that same Chloe Chloe is on the
message board she draws a lot of funny
pictures yeah she's very talented artist
ah
I don't know they're making vagina too
high okay Oh rich for character Regina
Jo my sister didn't thumb
I hate proximity months okay richness
your do lasers we can do whatever you do
laser you know we've talked about books
before I don't know if I've mentioned it
on a stream yet I just read wool
have you read hey I got red wool wool is
a is a collection of self publics it's
like a collection of six short books
that was self-published online only and
it became such a big online phenomena
then they actually published physical
books and I believe there's a movie
option it is an amazing real fennely
waiting for some of head start uh I was
talking I didn't want too much time
while we playing it's all gone oh yeah
so I think I wanted everybody to be
paying attention hours oh uh wool
post-apocalyptic world that takes place
in a giant silo so the humans of with
your live in a giant silo and the
majority of the time is just spent
walking up and down the steps of the
hundreds and hundreds of floors it's
brilliant so people just walking around
makes for a compelling book
yeah I'll trust you though it does well
I mean Lord of the Rings y'all oh if you
find that compelling well well yeah and
it's you know it's a little bit about
it's like it's got a little a little bit
of a mystery element to it ton of great
sci-fi stuff really really neat
but you get the laser it was it was one
of those books that I started reading
and then decided to take an entire day
off of work just to finish me
well I mean not lucky me just because I
had to work extra hard the second day
well no let's still which lucky you need
to take off them what they work in true
that is yeah when you kill me by
slapping aren't you I'm gonna try I'm
the the great and terrible thing about
working for yourself is you can choose
what days off you have the terrible
thing is you never choose a day off
because you always have to work
I guess you forget you ever read the
name Greg sister book about Tommy Wiseau
and all the disaster or disaster artist
fantastic I really enjoyed that book I
mean the thing is that oh Jesus Christ
fucking later the thing is probably
that's it I that the story of Tommy is
so much more interesting than the movie
the room the room is is always
interesting
there definitely interesting but the
thing is the room is is sort of a fixed
object you see once you kind of get it
when you read the story of Tommy Wiseau
there is so much more that you don't
know that you just scream okay I think
that was a part of the rooms charm
though who's Tommy like having you
knowing that he was the writer/director
star yeah I'm I'm just killing it here
okay well you have the laser the laser
is fantastic dude and so uh you know
much like our love for Len once we
started watching Len movies like him
being the visionary was part of our love
you know sure um a club ooh I got a clam
clan
I got a club at play so disaster is you
recommend yes fuck fuck fuck fuck
oh I danced five kills I didn't dance we
ha ha Monisha last opera house down to
one help I mean yeah there you go um the
controls still sucked by the way I'm not
enjoying I am enjoying this but I don't
I don't like this game down that's
because I'm winning that's fine
um but yeah just Tommy was so is such an
interesting person and there's a lot you
know it that book very interestingly
doesn't um the more you learn about
Tommy the more questions you have it's
really just my weight if that's true
then uh huh and yeah it's a very good
read okay that's good it's always nice
yeah um so we did that anything else you
wanna fuck around with um you know we've
been at it for an hour let's take a
break okay cool
hey guys we're gonna take a little water
break I'm gonna run a commercial it's
gonna be super fun that's priming this

oh yes Jack likes hotline Miami
I played Adama Vina and it was great Oh
game is this Bonnie harvests it's a game
I got Anna cheapy venom nevermind
starfox no damage yeah this is a Grand
Theft Auto I just jacked that car that's
great
I think I could have taken any car than
others what what's there to discuss
about how long it's a great cam I play
their lot and you should you should play
it people why games they want to hear
other people say they like weekend oh my
life again love game more so what you
should do is get the hotline Miami
soundtrack actually you should drop
everything and get body harvest rich is
having a great time actually you should
go buy that Twin Peaks box set you know
oh
during the car I did not recover the
previously recording Mario Kart footage
so it's gone forever
or we can recover it I found a website
that I gave them a sample of it and they
were able to recover the footage but to
recover all two hours it would cost two
hundred and fifty dollars oh so guess
what that's big no hey check box you got
250 bucks right nope
i've streamed hotline miami before on
the jack solo stream so I probably won't
do it again
McKenzie was the great hero Oh first to
approve the use of the tank he resides
in this area use the tank that's great
keep up kid great good you've done what
you're doing
my guess is a real twin peaks'
discussion won't happen for another hour
or so
I believe J has some work to do I
believe so yes what your name is J they
all want to talk about Twin Peaks not
yeah B not gonna happen it's not time
yet some work for the work to do no oh
no and yeah for the for the mariokart
footage we have all of the the footage
of me and rich playing the game we just
lost all of the capture footage of the
game of the actual game and so I just
won't have anything to cut - yeah I'll
kick started I think that's a great
thank you I'll get right on that machine
gun they go so like well we'll still
have me and rich talking about the game
but I just won't have any of the actual
gameplay footage to cut to so I might
have to fake that heads up I'm not going
to make a Kickstarter to raise $250 oh
and by the way someone's asking if the
resumes have come in we have not gotten
a single goddamn resume you assholes
were supposed to send in funny resumes
and none of you delivered what the fuck
was the peel box been check since the
last stream whose recent two days ago
yeah just maybe there's something in
there now I don't know maybe we so far
we have not gotten any won't let me get
out of the inventory I feel about the
same register
it sure is no backup no no Oh leaving
that room was the hardest thing I've
done in the scary
nice no objective checks man oh yeah did
you guys see that the kick started it to
raise a couple thousand dollars for
potato salad yeah that's dumb that's
funny yeah it's almost as dumb as Zach
Braff's Kickstarter boom it's true yeah
yeah a guy wanted to make potato salad
so he made like a joke Kickstarter
basically he's like he's like you know
he I think he wanted to raise like 75
dollars for all the ingredients for
really good potatoes and people just
went crazy over it and given like p.m.
thousands to like have a container salad
partner because it's funny yeah well you
know I guess for them it might be a good
joke but I can oh my god he's gone rogue
oh no you're behind a fence he'll never
be able to get the map Oh John kilo I'm
looking forward and John kilo said he
sent his resume last Thursday and he
drew the Showbiz Pizza bear I'm looking
forward to getting it we haven't gotten
it yet
you send your resume to the address on
the red letter media website yes send in
your resumes and we're looking for funny
resumes but obviously red letter media
is not hiring anyone so we're looking
for joke resumes and we said that the
funniest ones we will read live on the
stream as a joke because it would be
funny because a few streams ago someone
was being very persistent about working
here we thought a good gag to write joke
resumes and send them to the PIO box
handwritten they have to be handling or
tight I guess they could be typed in
print types they could be typed to end
print it I suppose none emailed no
emails that they have to be on paper or
reasonable paper effects similar oh sure
tailor skins
oh no more bugs why would I press the
trigger do you look behind you you idiot
is that what happened yeah
oh my god oh you got a hundred points
supposed to be bad well it's not
supposed to be bad is it it's exceeding
you know Jack Mac the sub money for the
twitch stream goes into the thrift
stream like we you know we winds and
whatnot we bought some n64 games today
because we thought it would be funny to
stream that you can't jump over the
fence so say yeah twitch subscription
money goes into previously recorded
it'll mean rich and I could buy games
it'll mean we can do fun stuff for the
stream and for previously recorded does
not give it to you so no no a new
speed-up McFly mick murderface this game
does blah
I picked the wrong horse oh I can only
imagine this has got to be this has got
to be better than then this pain Dark
Rift I don't know you have to play it
you have to play it for at least 15 more
minutes
yeah mind then I'll do Dark Rift about
that I'm enjoying it Wow door no no the
money won't go to recovering Mario Kart
footage that is not worth it I tried
some freeware like video recovery
software and none of them worked one of
them kind of works and then it didn't
and it really doesn't matter we have
routinize reaction to it and so if
there's anything I need to show I'll
just fake some we footage and do now so
now you know the story yeah yeah there's
some footage of we made me with with
rich and Jay and so I might have to fake
us making movies again or I'll just show
them is because I still have my fucker
blah blah bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh what
Jackie leo says what if dark rift is the
extra of n64 games it could be the
extracts from a game that we think is
gonna be really bad it is amazing it's
pretty bad yeah this is this doesn't
look terrible yet does it usually it
looks terrible sure what's ugly
I hate it you hate it yeah I believe we
started with some shiny gold 9 we rocks
Goldeneye for a while and then we played
perfect dark which is basically
Goldeneye with with a lady spy okay and
now we're playing this and then we
haven't gotten to Mario Kart no we've
not gotten to Mario Kart yeah
don't worry or do you want to play my
regards everything depends on how late
you're streaming wait we stream as long
as we're awake and as long as we're
we're not too rowdy in here you you
won't hear us yeah yeah so then we're
stream until we get fucking sick of it I
should tweet that you're streaming I'm
the official red letter media to each
other oh no these people are paying
attention to you right now right now a
380 get ready for that but go oh yeah I
have not heard it oh god I am NOT hurted
oh I had not heard that the crummiest
breeders song that was ever written mmm
fuck this time I'm still like somebody's
car hey you is this you cough sounds
stupid neo stupid yeah we're not gonna
play
Deadly Premonition we don't care about
it fly yeah it's no no it's it's like
it's like Miami connection where they
they deliberately made a modern game
look like a cheesy 80s action movie in
fact be the friends forever song it
plays during the end credits
oh no that's what's different is a far
cry yeah far cry Deadly Premonition
that was gonna look great right look
dragon Ellie permission is completely
different game even I know this I don't
know what dragon is Eddie I think so
we're not gonna play blood dragon have
another drink Jack I haven't had
anything to drink some eyes I don't
drink that often x-men so the crummiest
breeder song is Lady t-top I think you
misunderstood
yeah yeah tell me premonition is the
game people were saying it feels like
twin peaks' oh okay oh sorry
I bawled again I have fuluo Jews I have
played Jack is smoking everything all
this car jack so like that I'll expect
all the crack I spoke to all the drug
just got here and the kradic is going
sorry sorry
now lord knows after a movie like
boyhood you need some crack Ruby like
boyhood you need a map no no don't
review spoiler alert along innocent oh
good yeah refrain
I like that richard linklater alone
sometimes a lot what's his movies a
slacker and waking life before sunset
yet were sunrise and were that other
thing before the other thing before this
that sounds like well you know he's
taken a lot of chances and made a lot of
different types of things what's cool of
us we can act black I think that was
just really fun yeah he did a gangster
movie oh that's right yeah um what was
that called it was like its first bigger
yeah but he's tried tons of shit yeah
well good for him yes before midnight is
that what it's called
yes yeah thank you ho ass ho ho ass ho
is a new subscriber macho's has been
very incisive commentary tonight he did
your acid perk 3 before movie no meaning
to yes
Human Centipede in the karyesh
they like his philosophy for babies yes
yeah good like a movie I love the
animation in it but holy shit
oh yeah it's no slacker no and I've
actually watched his his very first
movie is on the criterion DVD of slacker
and it is just fucking unwatchable
there's a movie called something like
it's impossible to learn how to plow by
reading books oh it's yeah I know okay
the title alone is sort of like stoner
philosophy sort of until I just got
bored and fast-forward and he walks into
the room then he left side of the room
and he walks back in the bedroom he
takes a nap I think maybe there's like
god damn it stop
but slacker was slacker was already
fucking work of fucking genius
how much I like some flag I mean
obviously it's very episodic so yeah
portions of it I like if somebody don't
like as much yeah but I mean that up to
an overall sort of portrait hood I get
the feeling that it was the kind of kind
of portraiture of Austin at the time
as well and I saw it I mean I saw it
when I was 18 I don't know 17 like I
just I don't even remember how I knew to
rent it it was one of those things like
that I watched Twin Peaks when I was a
kid I never do that and I just you know
it was one of those things that I hadn't
seen anything like it at the time so
that helps a lot in terms of my you know
my appreciation of it I mean what am I
looking for
I don't know where are you going oh I
don't have no you should stop this sucks
do you want to stop playing no very
little
okay we can talk a little bit someone
asked us how bad our emails blew up
after the sanik review my my Twitter
feed was a lot of hates oh yeah people
you know what it got I think it got a
really good conversation started
and I think I'm really happy with the
sonic review thick rich and I made some
really fun points and had a good time
playing a classic game so you know it's
what's what's really upsetting is like
anyone who who tries to make an argument
or our ask us a question about something
we already addressed in the review
Mnet's like it's in the review we've
already addressed that that's my
response is oh that's a good question so
AJ what what previews played before
boyhood Woody Allen movie do a movie
every fucking years gonna stone in here
still yeah the trip to the sequel to the
trip that Steve Coogan movie oh cool the
trip to Italy yeah yeah yeah yeah pretty
good oh I'm excited about that I loved
the trip um
Calvary from a director of the guard
which neither of those things mean
anything to me no I don't know kind of
interesting it was like a priest and he
had a gun and I think that was it oh
well the guard was that one with Don
Cheadle and Gleason in it I've never
seen it but I've seen the DVD cover okay
use the explosive there we go
why are they asking what trailers played
before I don't know that's what they
asked and I know your question no I
think actually it's a good question it's
an interesting question I know so the
trailer for transformers 4 played before
for some reason the trailer you would
see me play a circle with that play
transformers 4 then the new mr. bean
movie which doesn't even exist that's
funny are there spikes in this game Oh
who's that someone asked it no it does
not look like they're I I think someone
like all the games in the very first
streams we play the head spikes that
would kill you
like we did sonic we did a thousand and
one spikes we did a bunch of games that
had spikes I would kill you instantly
and so it must be a thing I guess I
don't I guess it's a thing what is this
what is this game oh fuck right around
the corner yeah whoa shoot him with your
gun okay yeah so the garden is like yeah
in version Seven Psychopaths it's not
the same director but it must be the
same kind of style okay fuck the old
bean factory is not mr. beans penis
that's his father's penis
that's funny that makes perfect sense
yeah sure Oh Clem Fandango wants to know
when the new Plinkett review is coming
out tomorrow night it's tomorrow yes
actually the mr. bean movie oddly enough
you know bean factory like we we were
really excited to bring you that news so

it's like so when someone comes new to
the stream they usually get a commercial
oh okay that makes sense everytime they
come in new to the stream I don't know
what happened everything's fine right a
weird thing happened all of our LM ever
yes it's pretty true it's really true
freedom you know I'm using Chrome

we want to be won't even be playing a

this trick yeah that's good
stream us trick in your walk all right
man yeah do not send moonshine or if you
do send moonshine clearly label it
moonship oh man that shit will fuck yeah
I have I have it was almost
hallucinogenic yeah dumb drinking
moonshine is so mixed I mean we didn't
really talk much we mixed it okay but
keep in mind I have I have experience
drinking Everclear oh yeah
Everclear it's extremely extremely
efficient for being on the road for two
weeks because four guys and one bottle
of Everclear will last you two weeks
yep I'll see you at my mixer all the way
through what do you next what's the next
day when the agenda how do you were done
with this one have you guys talked about
guardians of the galaxy you know how you
can rescue an opinions on it I haven't
seen it so I don't want to do those
slits
alright alright let's give people let's
give people time to see if they did just
come on okay yesterday
everybody Josh Josh has ruined you
hearing my opinions on guardians and
you're welcome I'm pretty sure your
opinions will echo our opinions which
will which people will hear very soon
yeah man and then in the next stream you
can say whatever you want about it I
don't know how you sure I suppose yeah I
would like that's the thing like but we
have to wait till you're done you'll
know what actually the one thing I said
was I thought it was flawed but fun yeah
we're gonna wait till you're done
getting your work done and then after
this dream Joe Joe fun why would you mix
moonshine no I was mixing Everclear and
also you drink you mix every clear
because you do not drink every clear
straight it says so on the bottle
give me some corn whiskey I'll be right
all right I'm done all right just
driving around and shooting bugs and
walking on a building occasionally
sexily get out of the building and shoot
more bugs because no one in the Greater
Milwaukee area has a copy of Starbuck
well you know that's okay people jumping
big ol jump so you're done with this
game I'm okay guess what that means
we're oh fuck taking a break let's see
how No okay oh yeah we'll do it we'll do
it after that one okay so it's gonna cut
it's gonna cut out for a second and jack
is gonna play his other dime-store by
and this one's gonna be fucking awesome
why sure that's known as dark rift
augmentation used to do every clear in
Tabasco shots in college because that's
what you do in college yes that is
exactly good okay here at you take you
take over and read and chat have a good
time
let's see any plans of doing a best of
the worst with animated movies no
specific plans we would but I mean I
don't know whatever but he missed this I
think there's a set we have do we ever
saw that man that many ones there's no
way I know there's at least one movie
that's candidate yes we have some
individual ones floating around but I
don't think it will be I don't think
would be a themed one particularly
because I think if you've watched three
animated movies in a row that might get
really annoying yeah I can't and I can't
even necessarily say why that would be
the case that's like what's a bad like
you know yeah
what does see how many bad animated
movies how many best of the worst
candidate animated movies do we have
nothing does what I thought there was
one I was making a joke yeah Oh were you
guys seeing question answers no no no
and there's at least one Jessie's wrong
nobody cares what she thinks
Yeah right
oh we had to unplug it and plug it back
in again again it's true these are the
things these are the things that happen
yeah you brought the party yeah I guess
you're free to be in here I guess you're
free to be in here yeah I guess you're
free to be in here I guess you're free

[Part II]

word it's working oh my god you guys my
my cheap-ass n64 buy my oh oh wait yeah
no yeah yeah okay here we go okay except
we have the same problem yeah that's
okay this firefighter out of fix okay
everything's fine
unplug plug back in all right guys that
fixes everything all the time everything
so we're oh uh where's Goldeneye you
missed a jackass five hours ago
previously recorded on Twitter for when
we do shit can you change this here and
this right here and hit the update to
its I'm up I'm updating okay we work on
it there we go that's what we won't add
before somebody says it's
that looks awesome
all right let's do is prepare for battle
oh this is a fighting is this a fighting
game looks like well they're hiding
games are tournaments all right crisis
well tournament tournament I do go start
button how do you start with the start
but starting oh my god it's a two-player
game yeah gonna do I'm gonna do I'm
gonna redeem Monica I have this not ever
been shot the arrow oh god breathing
Sherdog
oh maybe it's not a two-player game what
is this game set player tit our Dwayne
trip to Monaco versus oh my god - it's
like SOS the little demon green oh no I
know you're thinking about yeah alright
I hope they wrap the grave kremens what
happened I think it's a loading screen
oh okay so I'm Demonica the red one now
we're back away slowly that was just a
dumb fighting game yeah ya know and I am
NOT playing you know
this is but we there must be like a
two-player yeah start did nothing
freaking out yeah okay so the B button
grabs face C that's B button so I'm
pretty good at that nice crab when you
swipe left arrow swipe ease down arrow
kicks right arrow wraps your fresh and
up arrow big swipe frenzy what was the
Sega equivalent when this came out what
was Sega coming out was that Jenna yeah
yeah was that the same leg was at 64 yes
or whatever graphics the Sega Saturn was
like a early CD system was it better
graphics yes yeah this is everything I'm
in a Tendo 64 looks wonderful everything
especially on an HDTV yeah there's no
upconvert we can see all the details I'm
very open about my disdain for the N
system over looks a comedy Monica so
sick I'm yawning watching the skips yeah
this is this is a really nice big bad
this was a bad this is a bad choice oh
hey hey make me laugh bitch alright
No dang
play Mario Tennis if you can send this
Marie of tennis tonight in the next two
hours we will absolutely we will totally
play Mario Tennis drop it at the bus
station
no I'm starting on Wednesday I started
looking for n64 games and found Jack
shit immediately I was looking for all
the good ones and we have four classic
we have four vintage video game stores
in the Greater Milwaukee area within
within a half hour driving back
Milwaukee and all of them had sports
game all of them had quarterback clumb
98 quarterback club
yeah it's all what in this game why is
it sacrilege to dislike the Nintendo 64
what I don't know why I guess it's
sacrilege for you to have a communities
get mario 64 which aged horribly well
this will never prepare know of time
which aged horribly you've got starfox
64 which is good well that's it's like
the graphics aged shortly yeah that plan
because Aaron's not doing anything
I was hitting buttons and nothing was
said nobody's moving and I'm not moving
all right I think Aaron just sucks
Oh perfect cuz Aaron didn't I mean yeah
yeah this is this is just really crap
but you know I'm gonna try to get a
directive thing on a third round
Mario 64 did aged terribly no sunshine
is better than Mario 64 in every way
maybe even the fucking galaxy games
blows that away before plays like crap
and comparisons tedious you know no it's
64 visually age terrible it's still very
good kick the games alright but I mean
it's not great anymore compared to some
of the other Mario games no come on
loads of all of our games that have just
taken a cue from rzc for like big yes
they have better
the same game that's it six before there
is Mario 64 it was great at the time now
it is obsolete yes that is it that is a
correct statement sorry you no no I'm
not anybody this isn't doing anything oh
yeah I don't think it recognizes the
second controller because we started the
machine with it unplugged sure cricket
yes I want to quick it all right turn
sunshine is floating trash doesn't you
my mother whose bunny
sunshine is floating trash no that
person is incorrect Miss Sunshine a
sunshine is great that hover backpack
was the shin press Start
nothing no I think we have to reset the
system
okay well stream might go down for a
second blue will sit there in children
watching this tonight no mario sunshine
was great the the the water backpack was
a wonderful addition cleaning up all the
goop using it as a little jetpack thing
was super fun yes all the levels where
they take await your backpack and and
those early oh yeah was pure total proto
gamma spiral galaxy a little awkward to
control sometimes getting the camera
around but
okay yeah I could probably ask again
okay I felt like it
nothing is a jeweler ship that was
working you or you is this a one-player
fighting game maybe it's just that
poorly program they didn't get the
second player working right wait no no I
don't think so this is a one player
fighting game that's no fun unless this
controllers
I can't was just me was just when I
can't believe everything it was just
working we just used it yeah the same
game bad game bad could you believe this
game don't do anything for some no no
that's not me okay game Network Kingdom
Kingdom Network game bad oh but you know
we've committed to playing we're gonna
play we're gonna play for exactly two
more minutes
alright shit cuz we don't want to like
look at this game the n64 is even
revolutionary they were doing 3d games
on PC right before the n64 so didn't
invent 3d didn't vet polygons that's it
just it just made them blurry and ugly
it invented it in a home console which
again you know was it was cheaper than I
don't gaming I see it that way which was
surpassed by the PlayStation which came
out earlier and and still did better 3d
yeah I'm not arguing that okay anyway um
do you guys want to ask me anything else
well I'm here because I'm do a ton of
these talk to Josh while you can he only
got so many good so many minutes
don't worry guys I'll play the game
don't worry about talking to me there
wrench
invented polygons congratulations
good work I think I didn't yeah well I
didn't think people would really be
interested I didn't think it would take
off alright here we go
I shave my beard off because it's
summertime I'm late - best somewhere
screaming because I have to work
street trash and best of the worst that
movie is too good for best for the worst
I love street trash I'm not telling you
that I'm not telling you that I'm not
telling you that no I won't change the
game for another minute
I like Black Sabbath quite a bit I do
things

question okay it's going so fast I'm
just trying to trying to help everybody

think I meant I had known both Jack and
Jesse before are almost much of a thing
because we just played shows together
and we just hang out and Jesse and I for
a good long time there we were our
banter playing together a pretty decent
amount so we got commiserate how we were
both the bass players and even though we
were in both bass players we were and
yeah and then I met Jay and then Jay did
a video for my band and it all kind of
just went from there we did going first
did I do
I think JD did one first and then you
did like five you've done all of the
other ones almost what was the first
time I met you was in a room screaming I
couldn't in okay I could have been that
makes sense I know I ignite and I knew
of you because your reality I came up
yes

to screenings a couple times let's see
Josh do you like jazz very much I love
jazz um Charles Mingus is one of my one
of my heroes um let's see what Josh

one he is asks Wally Jay 1980 do you
know do you mean who's playing the game
I'm Gor Jack green go the blonde one
with the big muscles yeah I'm always I'm
always hanging around let's see
think about everybody's asking these
things if I'm just skipping over judge
Holden asks me how can I make use of my
English degree or is it too late how in
God's name should I know it's far too
late no probably probably far too late
uh-oh Oh doing the obvious has a very
good question for me
I have a ring VCR and a copy of wrote on
VHS should I combine these two I'm
afraid my mind isn't ready to handle
what it might yield nobody is ready to
hit me you're not ready by recommend
doing it anyway yes oh god I I don't I
have said I love that fucking movie I
loved it I loved it so much it's such a
doofus it's one of the best things we've
ever watched my show yeah sure sure
working on it somebody's asking me about
pump musical of funk music I listen to
all sorts of funk from their moms on up
let's see do I possess typing skills I
type about 75 words a minute is the a I
am this just non-existent assent
apparently I think I've won every single
one flawless I know I know my controller
isn't doing anything right no no it look
like they attack like if I like they'll
walk to me and maybe find you staying
here
so it's just really terrible yeah Oh
somebody's asking about Krispy Kreme
I love that Krispy Kreme we don't have
that I would love to plummet
we just don't we don't have mega bend
anything yeah
some of these straight-up whoopee will
be glorious Oh what are you thoughts are
annoying go bang go that seems to be an
everybody question oh I like that on go
Bongo forbidden sounds a real good movie
sandy sandy like a manga yeah yeah it
said bed in the song yeah they did okay
science yes
yeah very very very good very good bands
I do listen to the jam
yeah I don't like Paul Weller solo or
the Style Council so much but I do like
the jin-hee maybe he needed that
particular rhythm section to be the best
of the best
rotor shirt explain no I didn't really
react you missed it that's too bad you
guys got to show up in time sorry lordy
we tweet when we are starting yeah you
don't get on the bus you get left behind
everybody come on bus does Josh like
Doritos Mountain Dew I like Doritos I
hate Mountain Dew I think that's most
people isn't it no people like mom doing
their own sick sick to my stomach
I don't be so anymore but I'm okay with
mom doing yeah yeah favorite blingo
blingo song that's tough the one that
goes like oh and go boy and go
like that one so much no I really like
the earlier wanting to blend go stuff
there's that EP that came up before the
first record came out I know it's not a
total fuckin history but it's got its
got the falling freshmen Forbidden Zone
the song it's got only a lad a couple
other things that's really cool
all role of that stuff all right I
honestly don't see how rich Evans can
think the PlayStation is prettier
graphics the n64 CPU blah blah blah okay
just just compare the n64 version of
Mega Man Legends which they just called
Mega Man 64 with the PlayStation version
of Megaman legend tell me there's no
difference some of the PlayStation
version isn't better in every way I
think that might have been true that
might be could be that might be
someone's attempting to make it dude
they're working on it privately that's a
good that's a good one go son you're
right you are correct
yeah not here not now as I like they
might be giants I certainly do spend a
lot of time listening to Lincoln when I
was a youngster and the idiots you know
my the very first album I ever purchased
the very first CD I ever purchased was
for that nice yes nice what do you think
about the new Weird Al CD I don't care
for it as much because I don't like the
songs that's based on but I'm really
excited that it's doing so well I mean
Weird Al it's 2014 and we're now has the
number one album in the US and that is
fantastic WordPress is great I like that
ooh
I am being asked who is the best twin
peaks' girl the answer is Audrey and if
you have any doubts from me you're wrong
come on come on
holy cow yeah like I thought a lot of
the weird our videos were fairly weak
yeah I understand like he was doing a
thing where like a lot of different is
through different producers and like you
know getting getting up that height but
uh I was really disappointed okay it
worked out for me yeah oh no it didn't
it did great for another week and
absolutely I like the aluminum foil
aluminum foil was in a really great Jam
yeah so like the Lord so it's like I'd
like to see we were now just having
YouTube channel commits they're putting
out regular contact okay I would like to
correct the swamp clocks lives thanks
that we're both bass players and bands
and that is not correct
there are bass players that aren't bass
players to describe this phenomenon to
you it's not worth the time yes
bees ball I have heard of mr. bungle
love the spam asks for coming back to be
fest the beef fest website is gone it
was just not there anymore so I have no
idea if B Fest is happening anymore I
certainly hope so
oh I I hope to go i if it's there I'll
go but I'm a little concerned because
yeah the site is just gone it I don't
know I don't know what the deal is
well B Fest is not like is that that's
like a that's not a for front room
that's like a student-run thing
it's like yeah maybe it's just no one no
one's doing it maybe well the will ever
ask for a restraining order against Jack
and can jack countersue free emotional
and mental distress cometh by the wheel
the wheel is fixed it's fixed already
yeah and yes to all your questions I am
suing not just the wheel but J and Mike
for before making me watch those movies
they're gonna think you meant the other
kind of fix is only partially trip we've
geez said once or twice have you yeah
don't let them know that yeah Elvis
Elvis episode with Colin Connor and they
grab it yeah Elvis dumbest secret Chiefs
keep three is coming to Milwaukee soon
and that's really cool I hope to be able
to go to that show we're totally gonna
be scare on non it's okay
also I just want to mention I've had a
point in this game where I've been
beating every single person with
absolutely no problem like mindlessly
yeah button mashing and I've hit a point
now where I cannot win against the guy
so that's oh that's the difficulty curve
so for games and then that's it for in
for games and then you get home Ikuko
Jesus
yes III in vented the wheel that's true
I did invent the show but I invented the
wheel aspect of the show and it's great
the wheel is drink I haven't even named
game station 2.0 why does this no longer
exist it's become free right basically
yeah pretty much
Elvis Elvis continuing we're still
talking about like that and they totally
love phantom us because again it mixes
here mic patents and your Trevor Dunn's
and your Melvin's your puzzle from The
Melvins and all that and Slayer too
because you've got Dave Lombardo in
there so yes yes I do I appreciate all
the interest in we should probably stop
talking about it because it's nerding
out against everything else that's it
happening in this room hi but I can't
stop talking about it
here is your stage now here we are
playing a shitty n64 game talk about
whatever the fuck you want trying to
give other people a chance someone's

bass player can't remember who Matt
Freeman has anybody nothing

overrated apathetic when music is the
best thing ever okay fuck you lord
necropsy I don't have a favorite death
metal man necessarily but I did once
stand in line to get Cannibal Corpse to
sign a baseball for me in the game they
assign the baseball that's correct

Oh somebody Elvis Elvis cuz I'm just
getting all the good questions from
Elvis tell Boris and they are very
interesting they started out as like
kind of a really sort of Melvin's ease
slow heavy metal thing and then as the
years go on have just put a lot of
different influences into their music
from like early new immigrant IV metal
up through like j-pop and all sorts of
weirdness
they really mix it up and I really like
that there are a couple records a Houma
note which is one that I really liked a
lot they did a series of four seven
inches just before the fight at the last
couple records that were really good
yeah I love those guys I like even when
I don't like what they're doing I like
that they are pushing and trying
different things they're very interested
in in in spreading out their
their ideas also dreamy we have
unlimited continues oh god it just never
stops I've been I've been testing I've
lost I've lost probably ten bet this
does a lot of funny papers
yeah it's in you as long as you can
street fighter did that you should
mortal combat stood well you're looking
like Oh rich Evans is greater than
Whitney Houston yes congratulations
thank you thank you
I agree okay not here not now has asked
me if I like the men swans I like swans
although again they make a lot of music
they started in the 80s and then went
through the eighties and kind of broke
up the early nineties and come back
together there's a lot that I need to
explore there but think I like found the
cheesy maneuver it's a baby
we should just use that guy Oh Steve
delay 5000 is asking who would win in a
fight Phil Davis from feeding frenzy or
Phil Davis from Russian Terminator I
think I can take it I got a wrench Phil
Davis doesn't understand what the
throwing stuffer
what did he have papers nobody had the
fucking papers be rich no wrench beats
papers general question do you guys like
the band cake yeah you like cake I'm not
big on kick that's cool
Jack Lutz cake actually I think is one
of those bands that similar stronger
demons no that's a she likes cloth yeah
Jesse was the one that introduced me to
death grips so you notice we had that
first album somewhere and I remember
where we got yeah yeah Jesse put that on
and you got to shame she's just doing
that no no he has to all these got to
wonder I'm looking for
Jack have you seen Mission Hill my
confusion answers the question yeah Jim
we live in a loose on that but if that's
the right okay that's the right one I'm
thinking of sure yeah
ooh oh this is a good man this is gonna
not Trez gin asks me which best of the
worst movie not containing camera
whistle you've been most improved by
replacing the character with Cameron
Mitchell all right I've got it replace
back problems no no no imagine it all
the speeches in that movie all the
speeches no cuz all right you can't have
too much Cameron Mitchell distance you
cannot have too much Cameron Mitchell
it's not possible hmm let me think about
this
nobody's that would have taken care of
the second act no battle problem one
second yeah you just have weekend for
Mitchell takes over for the second half
did you see he's moving he's like the
drill instructor I like that idea I like
that mm-hmm what what's a movie that
that we watch that one just turned out
to be four and that's what I'm trying to
get like the movie with the Frankenstein
guy that same episode was rough
indicator Vindicator
yes Vindicator good abusing camera yeah
all right because that's the kind of
movie that he would be in yeah and we're
gonna prove but it still would've been
all them that was fun bad yeah oh man
Oh
to look at all right tried do it now now
it's two players Cameron Mitchell meter
oh that's a handicapped uh I don't know
I can't switch characters but with the
deep end yeah that's just brings the
health up and down okay yeah um Cameron
Mitchell in the killer is bi slinking
through dumps and attacking ladies
I'll just Elvis I know you're asking
about amps and cabs and stuff I'm really
not much of a gearhead in that case I
played fender bases i have trace elliot
amp that i like quite a bit cat sir I
think I just have a cab it's not a name
thing that bought from a friend of mine
if anything I was particularly sort of
recommending Trace Elliot definitely
trace Elliot I discussed it back I was
discussing it with Keith who you may
remember from a little band called the
Kryten he is a trace Eliot guy through
and through
so yeah trace Elliot for sure
basis you can figure out what you like
and what you're comfortable with just
you know buy some cuddles everybody
every bass player needs a class battle
every last one every last one you know
yeah I'm gonna go ahead and agree with
also the alesis ion and micron I'm a big
fan of those I actually got jacked by a
micro micron yeah I love it I use it as
a midi keyboard all the time yeah and
it's a very good analog modeling sort of
keyboard where you're able to twist
styles and make you know actually just
physically make the sound change and
that's a big deal yeah because a lot of
crap
you know like my Winkie where you have
to press buttons and it just doesn't
work the same which rich is really good
at this game
Richard wretches Nicki and Jack is
Scarlett he might have broken the game
Oh

break you broke your game oh that was a
game this is too awesome we can't top
this that's done we're guess what guys
we're taking a commercial fuck these

control spoon room the fuck is happening

frosted here what is it doing that's
making you go you we have to describe
these things as a fucking gaming stream
I'm sorry um so just moving Oh God
moving feels weird and I moved and it
felt really weird it felt weird enough
where I said you like what's weird about
it is four words really backwards or
something or no no I you know I forgot
that I was playing the n64 for a second
and I pressed forward hoping that I
would look down and now and I moved
forward I have no idea where Oh there's
probably probably supposed to go to that
yellow dot oh the hooses kid Megadeth
yes yeah the question is Megadeth that's
my whole question in my response is
Megadeth yes yeah that's a good response
seriously though rust in peace is a
fantastic album it's great when you can
when you connect somebody that's got a
lot of ambitions and some songwriting
experience with a couple of really
awesome jazz players I'm sure anyone is
in the metal is read about this whole
thing with Hardy Freeman being like went
to Japan and is teaching all sorts of
guitar and English and things and all
this blah blah blah um
but those guys Bri fucking fantastic
that record is a stellar sort of
benchmark in crash metal alright yeah
there you go same question Merc yes yes
the answer is that question is yes sure
Bane is a character that does exist I
have no tattoos in multiple mediums
no tattoos no Matt one oh man you're not
hardcore at all if I have one planned I
just have to get it I have no idea what
I'm doing in this game there's a yellow
dot so I'm sure I'm supposed to go to
that yellow dot Oso has asked how I feel
about anthrax anthrax are probably my
favorite of the big four thrash bands
what are the big four thrash bands they
are anthrax Megadeth Metallica and
Slayer okay and anthrax were the most
consistent high level of excellent and I
assure you to like me
them above anthrax oh okay I get them
Elvis delvis I fucking love The Melvins
I don't think they're great spanned ever
because they can be very hit or miss and
they put out way too many records um but
I do love them very much ah mutation I
think Mastodon are
and not my thing so I don't know if I've
heard Mastodon never I've heard of them
I don't know I cannot for the life of me
think of a mastodon song well see that's
not a good time yeah what's the story
here jack do we win this game
yeah oh I have no fucking idea they
haven't told you no this is the first
thing that I'm doing and I don't know

gay aliens
yes gay aliens okay yeah you know you
missed your opportunity there you should
have said gaily oh yeah yeah but you
know you drop the ball and I had to pick
it up so Oh Sassie rich I don't have any
particular thoughts on your client Brock
Lesnar but I really do wish you recall
because we'd have a nice discussion
about about wrestling that I can't even
think of right now he's gonna come home
and I'm getting way too way too far into
this on a hanger for the wrestling I I
stopped watching wrestling in the early
nineties I started again recently it's
gotten very interesting again uh you
know y'all for me though the wrestling
history for me mmm I was a kid I loved
the door Hulk Hogan sure and you know
Bobby Heenan Roddy Piper oh I I hated
those men with a passion sure with a
horrible passion recently recently I was
watching some old wrestling videos and I
yeah yeah it's so funny the way that
works yeah I I wasn't in when I was a
kid I wasn't really into it apart from
you know every once in a while thinking
it would be like a Saturday night's main
event or something like that I would see
it but I didn't get real heavy into it
again until post-college
same time was playing Bolton I got way
into wrestling because it was there was
a different sort of surge in it then
dropped off for a while and recently
have kind of gotten into it again just
because I know there are some friends
that I haven't hear that to work at bars
and they get you know that everybody
gets together at the bar and they put on
the pay-per-view and then everybody gets
together and has a good time and I got
kind of back into who's cool and you
know seeing guys like CM Punk that are
just really good wrestlers that worked
really hard to get where they are and
Daniel Bryan and people like that that's
just way more interesting than write it
out you know actors that yeah throw each
other around hmm I don't think there's a
single player mission in this you
serious
what are you doing unless I am messed up
somehow you know what here's what we do
Charlie I'm hitting the reset button all
right hi I remember I was a kid down
there's a WWF like show your wife gosh
our area yep and my parents like we see
it sit near the aisle Hulk Hogan ran by
and I reached my arm out and touched all
Colgan as I ran by and he was sweating
this fog oh yeah yes I just I think I
didn't just like turn around I just like
wipe my hand off
there's worked way up yes it's
disgusting yeah yeah I was glad I got to
see hope and be tend to be us oh yeah
yeah so so this is what happened tonight
choose your reality right so I go to
park which is our new a generic race no
single-player aspects challenge

sassy rich wants me to talk about Twin
Peaks Twin Peaks was a television show
that was on for a number of years two of
them that is a number it had a lot of
actors and there was a mystery who
killed Laura Palmer and they solved the
mystery and then the show continued wait
we need J mama didn't just talk about
that this they just want me to talk
about Twin Peaks and I won't be talking
about the new stuff haha bye Jay Jay
made some promises oh okay he's he's not
here no he's simply not here no I built
a J it will be here later I believe but
I will talk about it at that time I'll
probably be busy later I don't know if
they're doing that tonight
oh it's getting late I can't believe it
I heard a wider so light I don't know
why she's in a way to either maybe maybe
there was a car accident
Oh maybe red letter media is dead right
now
that's possibility I mean there's stuff
to play perfect card no property you
don't know that it's true you know what
I'm willing to bet on that well that's
that's fine Twin Peaks was on ABC um I
want to say it was in the eight o'clock
time from time slots in central zone um
they also though the David Lynch mark
frost also has a show called on the air
that was on ABC that I really enjoyed
quite a bit it was a sitcom about a 50s
television show a variety comedy program
that all everything always went wrong
all the time
okay it was what was that on the air
it's called they only made six episodes
that's why I haven't heard uh only two
of them aired three in some markets uh
it was not very well accepted oh are you
on drugs the error was toxic
I need a spycam okay all right um yeah
it was it was not very uh the network
didn't find it very interesting because
it was way too fucking wacky to be on TV
yep I think the last episode is I can't
even believe they thought that was going
to get on television it's it's
completely surreal and I loved it I
loved it it's like watching it's like
watching that last season of Space Ghost
Coast to Coast except that was on TV are
you are you familiar with I think it's
called alternative three there was some
kind of British science show I forgot
what it was okay but their last episode
was like normally a science show but
they made up a bunch of shit about Mars
and a conspiracy theory to put a colony
on Mars because the earth was slowly
dying Wow
yes Wow yes and there are people to this
day I guess that believe this I need to
see that it's you can find it on YouTube
okay okay that's great that's right on
my ah yep just a plain old regular so a
bunch of shit they like fake some kind
of like Mars landing footage oh that's
awesome that's awesome okay
apparently yes okay noted it alternative
three was the plan to colonize Mars
because the environment on earth was
gonna be coming in hospitable for life
nice yes
oh man okay whoa look at that picked up
night minun boom then that there you go
uh uh boom you did it
I won I won perfect arc because they
can't be from terrified nitrogen uh
right yeah when I won I want it perfect
there see Harry fed is there a place on
TV for a show like liquid television not
an mtv anymore um probably not even on
Cartoon Network anymore they've gotten
so specific with the shows which is a
bummer because I remember a lot of
really good short subject stuff on there
I mean that's where Bugis Butthead
started on flux jaywalks
looks the max boy and what's on the well
the next was separate next wasn't liquid
television no that was that was at the
same time but it was not on the Patrol I
got a certain caliber oh yeah yeah yes
it did um climate is Keith I want to say
ah is all right I think
Oh cookie cookie yagya milk on the max
was fucking fantastic anyway and liquid
television was really cool but I don't
think there's no place like that on I
mean that's what YouTube does these days
i I don't know what J and Mike's
thoughts aren't guardians of the galaxy
I we've seen it we've all seen it but I
have not talked to them about it
we don't hi Gretchen I don't want our
beautiful and perfect opinions to taint
J in Mike's obviously biased opinions
because they love everything about
marble the marble thing they're Marvel
fanboys oh boy which is why they kind of
seem to have liked and hated Marvel
movies and equal measure Oh another
friend is back Oh little friends are so
helpful
Becky looks gonna get old quick now
let's meet the first time yeah the
second time I look on doing well the

you should learn how to Amy Oh what what
are my thoughts without without getting
specifics on can I set this earlier you
might not have been her I think
guardians of the galaxy is flawed really
but it is a fun movie so there's that I
won't get too specific because there you
know there may be something I'm sure red
letter media and officially get specific
at some point yes so we can talk more in
depth at a later time and you should go
see a movie because it's always more fun
to be in
all right now somebody brought up
Mystery Science Theater and we can talk
about that because all my fucking god
alright um most most y'all I think you
you said you don't you didn't watch mr.
Eason hi I've seen like be like a few
out the three episodes total alright I
have nothing against which is my
official opinion on the show channel I
have nothing against the show but if I'm
gonna watch bad movies it's always
something I do with my kijang I don't
need their commentary I like to get
together with my friends and provide my
home but you're nothing against shows
fine fine show I've only seen three
episode okay Jack did you watch it no I
didn't have cable girl okay
so I I have seen one or two episodes and
it you know what always bothered me
about it hmm is the people talking Jack
you sound like my dad I know and it's
like because they would always make
funny jokes but then I would miss the
next part of the movie because of their
joke if that makes any sense I it's a
fine show the one or two episodes I've
seen or it's fine it's fine
alright now I have seen I believe with
maybe an exception of the first seasons
of the stuff in the first season I've
seen every episode okay I love that show
I love that show I watch it all the time
my family used to meet up at conventions
from three different places when they
wouldn't used to do the conventions
which was not very often but it's a big
show in my life and honestly like I
don't know if I'd be in Milwaukee
without that show because I met the
drummer in my bands when I had a dr.
Forrester shirt on and he's like where'd
you get that and they got at the
convention that we were talk to my
friends it was a thing that said it
really doesn't have a lot to do with our
show we're not sitting here and writing
jokes about they they make fun of movies
they write jokes about the movies they
we react the movies yeah and then kind
of dissect them late oh yeah we're
trying to watch it from more of a
filmmaking perspective I mean like you
know message we don't sit here and try
to think of jokes yeah you know that's
not that's not what we do and so it it's
is a different thing
I think that it doesn't hurt us I mean
with that I was more conscious during
space mutiny because I'd seen I had seen
in that episode fairly recently so it's
like I'm not going to make the jokes
that they made because I know those
jokes when you guys were kind of getting
close to it I didn't want to say
anything because you don't know shit and
I didn't see that episode so it's not
you know it's not something that I feel
like I need to make a point about
because you're enjoying it just fine um
I was not making those jokes I mean I
pointed out when the girl was right back
on the deck after she died because
that's not making a joke that's pointing
out how atrocious the editing isn't that
movie you made so you made an
observation yeah right yeah and it
happens to be the same observation that
other people on a different show made
because guess what they also watch the
movie and shit like that is impossible
to ignore right yeah which is why when
things like that happen like during that
whole dance scene you know entity in the
Clube people were saying the same things
because they watch that movie too and
it's you're going to get the same thing
out of it because it's fucking
ridiculous but but Josh I mean isn't it
isn't it proper etiquette to make a note
of every other show that has happened to
watch the same movie isn't that I mean
isn't that what other shows do they
always mention every single other critic
or show that has watched the same movie
right
yeah but we're bucking that trend Jack
we're saying no because I know when I
see like a review of a movie the the
next two pages of that review is noting
every single other person who's reviewed
that movie remember yeah Roger Ebert
always used to wait for Pauline Kael me
for her review to God not to be like and
then he'd spend like a good paragraph
just talking about what oh this was the
Pauline Kael review said this that
always happened in every reveal we ever
wrote until she died absolutely you know
I almost want to avoid
just it's too much I know but I don't
think I think if you guys run across
something don't look and then find out
what's an MSD movie I just won't say
anything
sure sure we'll just but then we're
gonna do the episode in the comments are
gonna be enough my chemistry ki mr. TT
day and I mean you see it was Adams to
get out can you not mention that how
dare you not mention that that's you
know that's how it is that's my biggest
question is why why would I mention it I
haven't even seen the episode even even
if you had seen the episode like I and I
hadn't seen the episode but I knew that
mst3k did Santa Claus huh why would we
mention that look I don't know this is
my one question no I don't know I don't
know what what would make someone and I
have also seen a lot of Mystery Science
Theater comics what would make someone
think that we would mention yeah and so
what if we if we mentioned it what what
happened that's my campaign holy crap
weird um what would that change if we
mentioned it right and a lot of it 95%
of it was why didn't you mention it and
5% of it was what did you think you
could bring to it the same thing we
bring to every fuckin movie same thing
we do every night pinky try to watch
this movie
yeah no I'm totally with it it's it's
it's the dumbest and we receive a lot of
dumb comments and bringing up Mystery
Science Theater might be one of the
dumbest dad yep but I just I really
wanna make it clear that we're not doing
Mystery Science Theater and it doesn't
it shouldn't have anything to do with it
that's not what we're doing that's not
what we're trying to do wait we're not
no no you were trying to do our own show
yeah I didn't sign up for that well
that's okay Jack because now you have
this you have perfect art now I have
perfect did you did you remember to
write all your drugs for perfect dark
you remember how you wrote that whole
skit where you forgot to put the
pakkun I did I think it Anna by the way
I think it worked out really well I went
okay there's a few comments you're
saying Prezi Prezi maybe this by that
that thing you were looking at it
earlier I don't know but oh how much the
saying uh-oh singing pictures Oh
spycam yeah thank you
that fucking thank you that I that was
pissing me off I had this camera and as
I believe I supposed to - I wouldn't
leave just record everything had a
cheap-ass spy camera of the future is
this right no no that you yeah that's me
oh you're controlling it externally okay
okay Carolee no not but pumps in the
homes the palms in the homes
I like a girl with the bomb - no home
one ah
MC Hammer ever oh yeah I've heard of MC
Hammer I'll do I believe by that point
Jackie was just going by hammer oh don't
hurt him where's the camera I don't know
I don't care and I don't know what's how
we doing
uh it's been a while okay I'm gonna
complete this objective and then we're
gonna play another game okay cuz yeah it
just keeps happening
oh no this way know what I think I came
from this way okay it's a question that
it's it's what was asked a while ago but
well I'm remembering it now open X come
I would like to play over all right I
just heard about open XCOM the other day
I mean I know they're working on a while
I don't know it was done and watch the
trailer it it adds some functionality
and it's like an update to the classic
XCOM game I'd like to play that at some
point I didn't know was done till
yesterday though so so like bye bye bye
update the classic X kind of you mean
this is not I don't know if it's
technically a source port but no it's
not enemy I know this this is a
something for the ninety version 90s
version oh cool
user interface updates and the like okay
oh yeah I love this champ well I don't I
don't think that a beacon game to scream
we're going brah X come the old one is
the old ones a lot more micromanaging
I'm sure that's not a bad thing if you
like you know just to get in the depth
of that game right but I don't know if
that'd be a good stream
uh yeah well you know I'm sure people
who are digging the game would love the
strip
Oh four of them okay so now I took a
picture
this door is still locked there for fuck
now I have I do have I have a data
uplink
to the guy who says open XCOM be perfect
there there were plenty of people who
are bored we're playing FTL
it's uni what people don't like in depth
games yeah yeah that's really true and
which is a shame because FTL is what is
is a game that I watch on live streams
on that's what that's how actually how I
found twitch was watching FTL live
streams ah cuz I really dig it but it's
one of those things where not a lot of
people play FTL I don't think and a lot
of times you'll only watch games that
you play oh my jams you don't hear about
that ah shoot yo ass good all day
congratulations hey but that this game
sucks really I mean yeah a 1064 first it
looks better than gonna I'm sure for the
time this was awesome I feel like the I
feel like right now itself you admit you
can make something fun out of this but
when did I come in everything so
confusing a map would be killer
they don't give spies detailed maps
places they're infiltrating Jack you're
right they always wink I came in I came
in from there I think did I come in from
this time yes cuz then I said oh my jams
but this is the door I'm going oh well
that's an all caps I kinda needs
business oh gee no offense but RL RL em
often makes big assumptions about people
or general audiences well nobody nobody
else does that
Oh what assumptions we need that shit
for an FTL when we were streaming many
people wrote that they were bored
that's not an assumption that's that's a
fact there's evidence that is an
observation yeah based on sure not
everybody but enough
picked up shield tech item okay I'm sure
some of you would like it yeah I like
where the fuck what the fuck
how the fuck okay and this one right all
right
we're damn it yes respected this is this
area whoa but I need the Sun will never
stream XCOM Jesus Christ I just heard
about open X come yesterday cut me some
fucking slack ha ha ha ha oh you did you
did doctor - it happened what did it

door and that was objective - yay look
