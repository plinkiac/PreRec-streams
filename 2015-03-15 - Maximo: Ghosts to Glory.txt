[Part I]
all right that should do it
that should do it all right help me out
here how was how is my sound and game
sound and all of that snazzy stuff
yes this is a game that's famously
difficult I'm still gonna know death
running all right all right sounds good
I'm gonna fucking start let me just let
me just adjust the lighting here real
quick for my own damn sake cuz I'm gonna
get a headache
looking at this fucking fluorescent
light bulbs
this does not take place in the ghosts
and goblins universe but it is very very
obviously inspired by it I guess I guess
you can call it a a spiritual successor
but not not technically though playing
the game it's obvious where the the
influences are you got you've got the
double jump when your help is low you
know your armor gets knocked off and
you're running around your boxer shorts
lots of lots of nods to the the old game
ghosts and goblins ghosts and whomp
how can I trust you
as far as the the cartoony style of
things well it is it is kind of a a a
platformer it's an old-school cartoony
platform that's fine yeah you give you
give me 20 minutes till this turns to
terrible pizza train 11 what do you what
do you mean by turns to terrible I'm
really curious about that yes yes
technically I already died
I thought I had already started I guess
that wasn't the opening cutscene that
was the the idle video oh well whatever
I give a should I'm gonna watch the game
cuz I don't give them fun I notice skip
cutscenes
I don't skip cutscenes so we're watching
this again and I'm gonna smile while you
all get frustrated that were watching
the cutscene because I am the anti Jax
yes technically technically this is a no
death run but you start off the game
having already died even though
obviously we know that we know that and
I'm just I'm just gonna let this
cutscene we all just watch play out
because you know why because it's making
me smile it's making me smile to do that
I am a sadist captain to picky I am I am
totally a sadist watch this cutscene I
may I may restart the PlayStation 2 and
make everybody watch this again because
I am a horrible evil human beings are
all red skips all the cutscenes trust
you yes I you're right
quints Omni akai I must have missed one
of the QuickTime events
you must find the Sorceress's counselor
they will help
why are you helping me alright so
everybody take bets when when am I going
to die out when does that happen
at what point does rich Evans die in
this no death run because I have done a
successful no death run in this game
before it's just I haven't played this
game in probably over a year so it's
kind of almost an unrehearsed no death
running I've not I've not practiced all
right so here's the game you run around
and you jumped and there's a double job
and you collect coins and you buy things
with coins I mean this is all pretty
pretty standard stuff right here is a
first little gameplay thing there's a
chest but question mark over said it's
locked so obviously I need some sort of
key which I know right where one is
here's there's normal wooden chests
these aren't locked more coins here's
the key oh oh the ground moved up they
like they like doing that in this game
that's another nod to the classic ghosts
and goblins were you know there's
constant earthquakes and platforms are
popping up out of nowhere they do it in
this game in 3d you know I got I got the
helmet that gives me just a little bit
more health and I'm gonna grab these
coins I missed down there because why
not
why not
checkpoint which snowed Ephraim I'm not
gonna need that but here's the other
thing
hey I really don't need to collect
because this is a ain't no death run
gravestone see this is a solace in the
headstone and you collect the souls for
death then you get I think it's like 50
of those and you get a continue
cuz this game is so old-school it has a
limited amount of lives and continues
which you know I think gamers these days
are so coddled that that's the reason
people think this dick game is difficult
because you only get so many lives and
then you can't continue oh my god but
it's not it's not that hard a game
there's some nasty platforming stuff in
here but for the most part it's doable
you should not have hit me oh I got
power up here I got the flaming sword oh
I missed him goddamnit
first I'll like no ghost
you know this ghost in this game I don't
know there are goblins this game might
be goblin free which is okay because
it's a homage to ghosts and goblins but
there are no goblins in the title of
this game this is maximo ghost - glory
so ska blood free
you know watch out always earthquakes
dropping out lava pits appearing out of
nowhere other thing I don't need to
collect because this is a no death run
there's a extra life heart a soon to be
failed no death run so how many how many
minutes or hours have you decided I'm
getting in this game before I die
oh and you collected a little power-ups
sometimes they they randomly drop like
this one here it's the the shield throw
so now I can throw my shield but I
haven't demonstrated this yet the shield
will break after a while see you have to
actually be it's one of the things I
like about this game you have to be
strategic with the shield the the combat
is an one on one hand simple but also
complex there's things you got to take
into account like it's not a it's not a
button masher you don't know when when
to hit your enemies and when to use your
shield or wanted to just take the hip
you can see there I ran into my first
fake treasure chest
not bad not bad you know I probably
shouldn't be going down here just for
the stupid diamond I should I got to
keep in mind I'm doing a no death run
that I a completionist 100% run I
probably did not need to even risk
falling in this lava down he's gonna get
that but I'm stupid never claimed over
smart
I claim to be slightly above average on
a good day
let me speed up my doctor said I don't
need to do that I just need to burrow
through the fucking game
Oh
three powers not bad not bad things are
progressing there's nothing let's talk
about it lease nothing I can think to
talk about I'm bad with talking as you
know so those guys I don't I don't do
very well and I'm concentrating on
cocking well also playing you can see my
my fire sword it's fine
every second system that wasn't even 30
names you get 20 seconds of ulnar
ability yeah that's terrible
you know what I'm gonna blame twitch I
have not heard the last three what the
fucks there's almost maybe it's because
I turn the sound down a bit on my
headphones maybe I miss them because the
vent maybe and I send me a list the
people I've missed and we'll get him
later we'll get it later let me scroll
up see if I can see some of them if they
haven't already scrolled up completely
out of my my dad here I will think
scrolled up as far as I can I don't see
the what the fucks I'm sorry all right
continue on with a game how am i doing
I'm doing okay I'm doing okay
playing this game everyone can see that
having a nice quiet night playing this
game is Jack Jack a sec you can blame
you can win Jack through this again I've
got nobody to talk to him you know how
well I do like nobody to talk to
why don't I announce these on Twitter -
I believe Jack announced that on the
official previously recorded Twitter I
don't I don't have my own Twitter and
quite frankly I don't ever plan to that
seems stupid I'm not I'm not
narcissistic enough to want to
constantly tell people about what I'm
doing I'm at the mall nobody should give
a fuck Nevermore
get it get it I made a reference to
thing do we all remember thing famous
thing
I gotta I gotta I gotta turn this down
because see I'm listening to I got like
an audio issue with the capture card I
can I can listen to the computer audio
and that's probably why I'm not here in
the what the Fox but it's at a delay
which is gonna throw me off in the game
so I I have to have that off or it's
gonna cause me to fuck up because this
is a no death run this is serious
business why did I pick this game I
picked this game because this is one of
my my favorite PlayStation 2 games it's
it's just very solid challenging yet yet
fair action platformer now this isn't
really like with Mario 3 - mario 3 came
out suddenly platformer meant you know
walk around and explore what stars and
that's not that's not terrible what I
mean this is this is actually a
platformer we're jumping and whatnot
makes a difference where you can fall
into a pit of lava and die it's not it's
not I explore and collect the things
it's just straight-up levels platforming
jumping fighting when this game does
that well
I gotta want to jump and hit that law
medicine die try not to die there's
another useless checkpoint this is no
death row son of a bitch
alright okay do you wait for you bird
why do birds hate me what I ever done to
birds why birds always enemies and games
the old Ninja Gaiden games was the birds
that killed you more than anything else
birds hate video game characters
this game is is inspired by ghosts and
goblins but it is not a direct sequel it
very much wants to be an official ghosts
and goblins dance game but it is not
should be this games great ocean ocean
ocean don't want to die don't want to
die we don't want that so still wife
rigea died it's not die I am completely
deathless so far this is a perfect no
death room
it's the mr. repeller
maybe I'll get it maybe I'll get an
upgraded shield nice oh that's not bad
that's not bad I got foot cheese foot
Jesus that's pretty good actually you
can run on that ground with the you know
the skeleton hands popping up to get you
you can run on that no problem
not bad
fucking fucking kill you in this game it
is stephannie life I'm safe
I lived had not died not died
max no legs back it's been it's been a
while since I played this fucking game
getting lucky with the post drops
this is an older game they haven't they
haven't figured out that you should be
able to move the camera with the right
stick it's one of those those you know
older games where there's a button to
center the camera
I hope you're enjoying the chat they're
not gonna get much enjoyment out of
hearing me speak
that's why I could never do a let's play
video for what I can't talk to myself
you know I need I need somebody else to
talk to
so that's problem one problem two is
talk and game at the same time it's you
conceivably pull off a let's play video
if I just record it myself playing the
game separately and and did a voiceover
after the fact but it is what it is and
what I am can't change that can't change
that
this is a potential intersection
good good no death so far
is maximum Roman um maybe it's not
entirely clear especially once you play
the second game where nothing else in
the game seems Roman but that you're
fucking humming and she I should kind of
like the second game I like it a whole
lot this one is more about being precise
with your attacks when you attack and
and being smart about using your shield
second game's more of an outloud brawler
their combo brawler but pretty fun yeah
save station is what this is you save in
the hub world but good point good point
actually know what I'm going to Land's
hundred coins
I might have technical problems at some
point that's what I'm worried about
because I don't think I don't think a
technical problem should kill the no
death-room I'll say the coins kiss a
fancy meeting about
yeah the second game of this says you
fighting clockwork monsters not
skeletons are also kind of creepy and
fun it's neat
no more stuff in here idea hood
basically got full health I don't really
need any of it I'm just gonna no
deferent no death run I'm just going
straight through to where I need to go
all right every every jump in this game
we don't know death run it's just a a
heart attack in the making
I think that's just another flame power
well we don't need it melting okay
our merge nervosa like that
invincibility what I don't really need
it
the invincibility will stomp a lob off
color so taking it slow and easy anyway
it's going to be damned
hey you know I my only real goal is I
just want to make it respectable
I'm not expecting to beat the game with
a no death run but if I do great
thanks to that foot cheese and it stands
wave yard arm pit thing all day not
taking a damage which is great
a sock I'll be happy if I can make it
through the jungle the graveyard and the
jungle stages I'll be happy if I could
do that anything after that it's just
kind of bonus let it shit like this be a
fucking heart attack
still life still alive
yeah no problem
no problem can do nothing on the ground
that spawns much melodies behooves you
to take those out potion potion room Mon
door number one key can skeletons Oh Sam
in my boxer shirts now I really need
armor fuck fuck me all right
do you have armor
yeah door number one was a goat Monty
Hall reference reference to thing that
happen Monty Hall problem I get it
hey kid it I didn't get armor I didn't
get that I think it the one thing I need
I think I'll be okay yeah the pre-order
for this game was a pair of heart briefs
or boxers so you can actually own a pair
of maximo underwear I didn't pre-order
this game but I just remember that
because that was it's kind of a cute
promotional thing
your one arm oh fuck off
whoa fuck you fuck you fuck you and die
bastard
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck jack is Jack is
not here Jack is feeling sick it's just
me it's gonna be mostly mostly silence
on my soon-to-be failed maximo no death
run I need me some health
I'm gonna rely on my shield for bed
what should be just what I need
this is the the hub world by the way
let me buy healthier saver travel open
camp I'll watch
we are we are now racing towards a
little secret area I opened up because I
believe my salvation lies within yes
we're saved all right not completely out
of the woods but we're doing a lot
better a lot better than we were a
minute ago
cutting it fucking close their head and
chest up here what was in here you have
the potion coins are never terrible
just make it to the next stage you I'm
not making it look easy this isn't my uh
this isn't my Orcs Must Die run where I
made it look super easy and people in
the chat we're saying this came so easy
no not really I'm making this look
exceptionally difficult
bad to the bone yes Armour hidden behind
me
games don't have stages like that
anymore you start off the stage and
sometimes they hide something right
behind you because your first instinct
is to move forward not backwards or
arias I see is see that the grayish
looking bar under the green bars that
are my health that is the health of your
shield you can lose your shield in this
game which you don't want to have happen
but on the other hand if you never use
your shield at all what's the point in
even having it so people bitch about the
shield big destroyable in this game I
kind of like it it keeps you from just
putting your dukes up and and being a
turtle or something I don't know I just
found shield health Rico so we're good
at full shield full health mana foil
skeleton get no ghost getting the best
of need damn it
super ghost I don't like the goal
there's hard to get extra life up there
but I'm not risking or something that's
gonna do it no good no death no easy to
fall in love it
what's in here
money I'll take mine I'll take
I feel bad as I am huh huh how about
that sweet spin move
come on bird
mystery
good
hey maybe I'll get some good why not why
not for help
oh what a complete fucking waste
complete fucking waste
this chest is the first wizard
like the old ghosts and goblins games if
you get shot by the wizard I think he
turned about either a baby or an old man
I know in the original game I think it
would turn into like a duck I think it
turned into a baby too and basically
made you you're somewhat helped us for
30 seconds yourself
keeps getting ready to shoot oh and I
think I'm missing around or down
oh you missed
I did okay
that's know definitely we got to keep
moving we got to keep moving
and I want to go back and grab that
missed arm oh fuck it fuck it we're fine
this game looks like a pre jak and
daxter game this game is better than a
jak and daxter game I always thought
those were overrated look Purdy never
really much cared for him though
especially when they added in the guns
and it was just weird they tried to turn
a cartoony platformer into like a Grand
Theft Auto game with a jak and Daxter
Seagal's a strange thing take a chance
take chance
oh wait oh that's the boss I'm not gonna
take a chance I didn't realize I didn't
realize that I'm luck that I ready all
right looks like we're going to make it
through the graveyard
without without dying if I make it
through the jungle without dying I'll be
very happy there's one platforming
section in there though that just oh I
hate it so much
fourth world was nothing but platforming
sections I hate
come on do your do your special attack
and let me stab your toes you know how
this works
we know how this works
one more you're dead because I got the
good sword come on come on you fucker
you fucker
Maxwell don't take no shit from a giant
zombie man giant zombie men can all die
hey so I'm doing okay at hard game I'm
doing okay things are going fine things
are going great for myself coke why not
you can get against the Kiwis army oh
wait I have to do a thing on the screen
when it's not pouring my drink and I'll
take the kiss cuz I don't care because
I'm not dying
that's the attempt you know I should
have taken the armor yeah that's fine
so fine no the other sources are still
in terrible danger please help them
oh my god she's talking with her mouth
closed yeah yeah an old games they did
that youuuu lip-synching in the blocky
3d art days when when there's no lip
model their mouth is just like a texture
maybe that that shit was an innovation
talking moving mouths what black screen
oh no the capture card is dining at me
let me see if I can fix this a lot we're
starting the whole fucking computer
unplug and plug back in the capture
device unplug wait awhile
look it back in come on
TV is singing the game but the program
is not I'm starting to think the
software shit
there's no there's no Jack urge a plan
for later Jack a sick jay is off doing
whatever you you've just got me you've
just got relative science if you want if
you want to take this stream off tonight
I'll understand I'll understand no hard
feelings
all right
almost there give me a second
almost there stupid stupid software
come on there you go there you go all
right we're back we're back
this is where you tell us you beat the
game and finish your no death run oh so
you guys you guys aren't alive you guys
aren't liking this game huh
not not liking the game or leg in the
game or I don't give a shit or you just
bored
you know he's chat amongst yourselves
all right here we go back in the saddle
swamp zombies
lenka Basinski would be proud he might
be a Shane I don't think he likes swamp
zombies very much I could be wrong
nobody nobody likes their older work oh
my god I made that full armor
all armored fine you stupid so I can
stand on that ground I've got foot
cheese let's problem up my feet I've got
foot cheese skeletons don't grab my feet
because I've got foot cheese
so I've been playing more that the whole
world remastered and I'm just I'm no
good at real-time strategy games but I
discovered that it does have a pause
button which for me that helps
tremendously I'm just not built for
real-time strategy and here's here's one
of the things I don't like about
real-time strategies like there was that
that that one mission where you have to
destroy the fleet that leaves your
planet we fight them and I built a large
fleet of ships and they had a large
fleet of ships and they did battle and
of course I I won no not I guess not of
course I won but eventually I won but
like most of my fleet was decimated I
came out of it I had like I came into
that mission with a huge fleet and then
I ended it I had like one surviving unit
and what I don't like about realtime
strategy games one of the things it's
just how worthless each individual unit
is like their little lives may mean
absolutely nothing and I build my
glorious fleet of ships and you know
they're all dead by the end of the
mission that's the way it's supposed to
be you just you just build more and you
keep throwing them into the thick of
things and I don't know I don't know
that I like that that's why I like XCOM
because each each one of your troops
they're their individual lives matter
not not a real-time strategy game that
shit's disposable
yeah I don't need this extra life I'm
gonna grab it even if I weren't doing a
no death wrong I wouldn't need it
some way I can get up to this little a
there we go
a ship at least I didn't fall into lava
I guess you guys probably want me to
fall into lava because you don't like
this game
maybe you just hate this game because I
made you guys watch the opening cutscene
twice just to be a jerk made me smile
huh
you made Richie Evans happy granted you
made me happy by being miserable but you
made me happy I think that's a fair
trade
don't need the potion no there's a every
go sir power up there we go
that new mask of sorrow power up I
picked up that's gonna let me do this
when I got that extra set of armor which
is somewhere where's another armor and
it was more armor there is
and now instead of turning into the gold
armor man I turn into the green glowing
skeleton of instant death doom which I'm
gonna walk with his fucking alligator
monsters no I don't want to grab that I
lost a better sword powerup because I
accept the grab
doesn't wanted theirs wanted him pick up
serpents maybe advantage tell no big
deal
here we go
here we go hey you know here we go guys
give me so much insta-death platforming
coming up
it makes me second makes me sick
rich why don't you go buy dick I don't
go by dick because my uncle was dick I
was named after him yeah kind of be
weird to have two decks so one of us
became rich which was be you know I'm
poor wasn't that a great story one we
called that mist everybody's fucking
time telling that story Barnegat a nice
here we go here we go
can't afford it almost shortly
you find hidden chests incidentally by
jumping where they are it's weird that's
why they do it
have you only gone through my shield yet
but I can now afford the slightly
slightly stronger shield
slightly more durable shield what's
what's good in my life right now
how's the fiancee fiancee it's fine
fiancees fine stop visiting her sick dog
your mother's house dog's name is Dana
sweet sweetest dog I ever knew like 11
years old right now and it just had some
kind of weird dog disease that I guess
looks an awful lot like the symptoms are
looking awful lot like a stroke like she
had no balance she was walking into
walls but III don't remember what they
call it it's just some kind of weird
brainy thing but her balance was was
fucked for a week they almost they
almost put her down because they thought
it was a stroke I guess they got a
second opinion from their vet and
sweetest dog I've ever met in my life
they get all of their dogs from the
shelter so I guess they're not entirely
sure exactly how old it is but when they
when they got it it was obviously like
abused like I know it had some kind of
weird markings around its muzzles like
they think like his mouth was just tied
shut with rope or something really weird
I mean I was it was kind of a mistreated
dog and sometimes you'd expect to
mistreated dog to be angry but this dog
just seemed grateful to be in a good
home like I i've never seen a like you
just feel gratefulness and being and
being loved by a family rat
than you know being tied up outside and
forgotten about wherever their ever the
held his dog game from and she basically
won the the doggy lottery Karen's family
is very good to their dogs oh shit I got
it for the wizard and nominal man oh
shit oh now I'm now I'm in the dark now
I'm in the tarp not good not good all
right but ya know her family very good
to their dogs they will spend thousands
of dollars on doggy medical bills they
had this one dog early on it was
diagnosed with some kind of hip
dysplasia or something was something
wrong with its hips and whole second
half of its life he had trouble getting
around but they never put him down
he was almost know up until the end he
was relatively happy dog so I've always
said any dog that ends up there won the
dog lottery you you fuckers stabbing you
make me get hit by that fucking wizard
I know this is black tar down here if
you get stuck in that if you sink all
the way down you die so I I guess it's
better than falling into lava if you can
fight your way out of it but I really
don't want to be in that tar
along the tower he can stay there I
don't give a shit
I have not died yet for person asking in
the chat this no no death run continues
perfectly what am i hitting a little
slower I'm just running doing your sword
can hit a wall which is kind of annoying
when that happens see right there I
tried to do a spin attack but the sword
bounced awfully hot
I'm glad person in the chat that has
faith in my know death run I'm glad you
have faith but I'm kind of out of
practice there's there's some some later
platforming sections in this that I'm
just I'm just terrified actually think
of one of the next stages as in bad
sections dies zombie
ah
yes all right that was brutal
rich do you do research when trying to
attempt a no death run for games you
just wing it
uh like for this one I just what iíve
actually no death from this game before
and the way I did it on this was I just
gave it one try every night and
eventually I just learned to do game
better
there was one no death run I did No More
Heroes to I didn't know death run and
the final boss of the game had given me
a lot of problems I did look up a video
just for some strategies to use on the
final boss when I did my my no more
heroes to death run I'm glad I looked
that up cuz I covered it talking down an
otherwise
but for the most part I the strat the
only strategy involved is practice I
want to know death run a game I'll
probably try like once a night
why do you guys keep bringing up Dark
Souls tonight I mean you guys like that
game I don't have any illusions of doing
a no darks a Dark Souls no death run
that's probably not gonna happen any
fucking time soon
you can throw your axe I'm just not
gonna be there field throw what
happening god damn it if I fuck up this
jump in the hub world I'm gonna be
pissed
there we go what makes this game
maddening from a no deathrun perspective
is the instant platforming deaths I mean
this could this could end at any moment
if I'm not in the mood for Dark Souls
I'm gonna move for this you don't like
this game I'm sorry but I do that's what
I'm in the mood to play tonight
oh this one's not bad
one that's that stage we have to jump on
the backs of all those turtles the swamp
water is instant yeah fuck it just
fucking that might be the death not fun
to that section at all my fan of skyline
I've never even heard of skyline
I have played some of the SimCity games
I can play it any minute while I heard
the controversy over the the newest one
and they're always online DRM bullshit
that didn't need to be there this much
is just everything that's wrong with
modern games online DRM and nonsense
bullshit they gain pay for a game that
you won't own huh that's a deal
you want to not own this game buy it
from us you all really own it see that's
a pet peeve of mine
everyone everyone knows that
shield I kept a shoe
we sent a laser blast
yeah you're right I don't like Steve's
dear round I bite I beg I beg game
self-esteem because really you have two
four four most every PC game that comes
out that's why whenever whenever I have
the choice I always buy games off of GOG
calm because they don't do any of that
bullshit you download the executable but
you can you could save that executable
to a disk and there's there's no online
based erm you just have that file and
you can save it and you can install it
whenever you want bitching about DRM and
I'm getting eaten by alligators because
man those things take off a lot of
fuckin health
no it's just a bit and he kept standing
there and he never stopped just standing
there and he died and I guess he got
what he deserved
that green ghost
he possesses you forbid I hate that one
blue ghost I can deal with they just
take away some of your souls which being
that I'm doing a no death run those
things are useless
I'm about to get 50 you'll see what
happens when I get 50 souls maybe it's a
hundred I thought it was 50 nope there
goes
where's that where's that armor there we
go come on alligator I don't have enough
oh I wanted it be
that's cuz I got the other armor upgrade
can't be invulnerability one it's like
at five armors now that's okay cuz I got
more
there we go that's what I wanted is
there anything that makes this game
unique it's just very subtly well done
game that's good platforming it's nice
designs nice combat it's just all around
good
the difficulty is challenging that's
what makes this game good 50 just for
the head fuck off
also what makes this game unique and
talked about this little bit just
joining in makes this game unique
compared to a lot of other platformers
that came out at the time this one isn't
exploration focus this one is
platforming focus it's not about
collecting all the jars or the Stars or
the fireflies the flowers it's about but
not dying because the jumps are hard I
hate this section this section might be
a death
I hate the section so much
this section here cost me a lot of no
deference because if I fall into that
muddy water its death fucking moving
platforms fucking fucking fucking I say
die Nazi
I don't need it it's kind of useless but
actually my I'm gonna wait to this worse
off imagine he runs a little bit faster
I think I might throw off my timing I'm
not gonna fuck around often did you used
to play this game because you're you're
pretty damn good thank you thank you for
the compliment I played this game a lot
this one my favourite PlayStation 2
games oh I thought I jumped too early
they talked about how much I hate this
section
it's relatively speaking not even that
hard just I've had many no death run
attempts and here so I hate this section
passionately
actually I think of us that one-acts
skeleton too got a number of my kills
knocking me off the platform's making me
drop straight in the water mid jump
have you ever done a no debt friend yes
I've done two no death runs of this game
in fact this was my first ever no death
run and pretty much anything was this
game I don't know I don't know why I got
obsessed with doing it but I just kept
saying this game was difficult and III
played it a lot I got kind of half
decent at this game and I just I kind of
felt in my bones that it was it was
doable it was possible so I kept I kept
trying like I said once once the night
for not every single night but like like
a month month and a half maybe not that
long while I was a while I on two
different no death runs on this game I
died on the last motherfucking boss and
that was painful
that was just fucking painful
and a snack a binder 65 percent level
mastery this is a no death Ron not a
perfect run shove it up your ass
tell you some of you people in the chat
you just you just got it in for me and I
get it
I don't get it nothing but nice to
people except when I call you names but
other than that I'm so nice to you
people
no bad not bad he's moving along just
fine
then our aliens commentary we never once
mentioned species did we have to how the
fuck is that relevant at all nobody even
remembers species it's like alien but
with sex
okay Geiger design but yeah Tyger Tyger
drew lots of things in this lifetime do
we have to mention them all
I never even thought of it
I believe in this game it's just
cosmetic but you can buy different
boxers that one's got a monogrammed him
from Maximo
fuck there's not killed by an accident I
hate everything I hate everything about
everything
what the fuck I love killing them from
the distance care what's in there
locked door mother fuck itself just want
to live just want to live it's the only
goal
scam doesn't want me to learn this game
wants me to die
right huh all right move right along
things are proceeding well now take a
rifle
get out of the swamp I'm trying I'm
trying to get out of this mom that's my
whole goal
to get out of the swamp and not die
getting knocked into the death water
it's a really easy here really easy cuz
I don't want to fall into that water I
wasn't too bad that wasn't too bad
then all the small office did I open the
gate

head my well my ear things fell off my
head ball hold on fixing them fix it a
thing yeah it's good enough for now all
right back to the game
all right there we go the ice levels I
made it past the jungle so I'm I'm happy
happy enough for this run I have not
made a fool of myself I said I'd like to
win
I'd like altima tulta McVicker e over
all stages I don't I don't think that
I'm gonna get through the underworld
though without the practice some
nightmare jump ceiling in the underworld
which you know spoilers there's an
underworld section fix up shield things
are looking great fuckin no chances
rich since Ustream ps2 games have you
heard of the zone of the enders series
lizard 64 yes zone of the enders is also
one of my favorite series on the
playstation 2 zone of the enders 2 might
be the one it sits in the running for
best action game ever made which one of
these days I'll end up streaming that
one I can't I can't not stream zone of
the enders to ever for now this is what
I was in the mood for tonight I hadn't
played the Maximo games and ages and I'm
like yeah we're gonna do that Jack's not
gonna be around we'll do a game I like
revisit the series it'll be great until
everyone bitched about it hey whatever
whatever you guys bitch about things
that's what you do I get it I get it now
rich is sick you know if if my life were
a we're Star Trek The Next Generation
like Star Trek series everyone else in
the ship Mike J Jack they they're
they're all Jesse everyone is sick with
the alien virus except for me I'm the
only one left and I have to save the
enterprise the only one who hasn't
contracted the killer disease so I'm
probably gonna be next
all right please come easy go
nothing nothing nothing nothing were
talking about up there all right
this counterproductive do you know that
from then I almost died in that small
little platform
check points in her League I'm not gonna
die if I do I'm done not fucking around
not fucking around at all no unnecessary
chances that's the the mantra tonight
not like not like with hand of fate
where I did some really dumb dumb things
in that no death run
not even gonna risk jumping from that
armored fucking fucking slow and steady
safe safe playing it's safe
so facie if I if I downward stab no
because he's the the swords pointing
through his stomach I will actually hurt
myself you have to you have to hit those
guys in the back come on come on charge
me so I'll just jump over you
and bomb
not easy
mobs I don't know who you're betting for
what but I fully supported
bring out that bad hammer people are
being jerks well they can go fuck
themselves they don't like this
perfectly fine game and I'm not playing
the game they like well tough shit tough
shit you don't always get what you want
in life how to not die do I take do I
take find the most difficult section and
get it out of the way or do I just play
it safe say I don't remember which one
is which right now anyway so I guess it
doesn't really matter I just have to
pick stage oh shit moving on moving on
health Kang's gone everything's going
they stand a helmet but barring that
we're doing all right go with the flow I
think I hate this one think i hate this
one this game seems easier than super
ghosts and goblins yes that's it's a
pretty hard game but super ghosts and
goblins is still easier than the
original ghosts and goblins which is
just nightmarishly difficult ain't got
nothing on the original
our yeah there's my marker it's worth
the best for this guy platform he's
finally gonna get me some icebergs sink
like these is guys your sink
I think they sink some of them sink good
that sink no that one didn't some of
them do doesn't know rest take the take
the quickest path to the Oh
die die oh fuck fuck
no not not gonna risk it
I want that potion but I'm not gonna die
for it not gonna die for it alright
alright not dead not dead moving on
moving on not bad don't die
moving on
slow and steady slow and steady slow and
steady do you wanna build a snowman
oh shit has jumps huh
fuck yeah yeah I got a cock shit mother
fucker shit I hate the suction so much
everything
catch Yeti
No
thanks for fucking your ears no problem
my you're welcome you are welcome
straight to the exit which is this way
gone down I know somebody's disappears I
don't remember which one which ones
disappear sink more accurately
live so far
Oh
should have to explain this but yeah ice
hard to walk on hard to walk on ice
definitely don't wanna fall off all
right
so far
I think I'm making it decently far into
this game I'm happy with this right
should things go horribly wrong I'm
still happy with this run swing a thin
air I don't give a shit don't give a
shit
potion was here
hmm yep ocean was there
gotta be missing my gate most definitely
once all taking this pie
asking about darkest dungeons and the
chimp let me let me let me get past
these slippery ice platforms and see if
I can talk about that game I'm not
having a heart attack while playing this
yeah the combat was a bit too JRPG ish
for me we two people stand on either
side of the screen they take turns
hitting each other using our most
powerful attack spam spam spam until one
side of the other is dead I I like
everything about it except for the
combat so far I'll probably play more at
some point just to give it just give it
more of a chance but OOP but so far I
liked everything about darkest dungeons
except for the combat which is probably
going to be a large portion of the game
so I tell you guys I don't like JRPG
combat and you guys you guys tell me I
need to play a game where you just take
turns and either side of the screen
hitting each other why would you do that
to me this is why I retaliate by playing
Maximo
come on yeti-yeti-yeti-yeti fire fire
make anybody's don't mind fuck
icky can't hurt you fucker say got a
shitload of fuckin power-ups though
normally when you when you die
everything you see those this five on
the other end with like the the extra
circle around them
those are your like power-ups save slots
when you die you hold on to those
otherwise you lose every other powerup
you have by by doing a no death run
everything is just backed up I got I got
power-ups coming out the ying-yang
I don't want to lose my fire sir
I'll take fire sort of rice
rich Evans doesn't like turn-based
combat JRPGs but demands turn-based
combat and strategy and yes because the
kind of strategy games I like like your
ex comes your master of orion's your
your moving units around there's there's
more to the turn-based combat rather
than just taking turns whacking at each
other while staying still in the same
place XCOM combat is a lot fucking
deeper than JRPG combat suck it
it's true it's true
I mean Final Fantasy is some boring shit
my one of my sister's was super into
Final Fantasy and I was watching her
play at once I may have played it myself
a little bit it was like this is
terrible this is terrible and that's
that's the one everybody holds up is the
good one seven and I fucking hate so
obnoxious characters and obnoxious
combat oh God
fuck look at this shit look at this shit
I'm just looking what they're making me
doing here
I won't hold my breath
all right made it
stupid stupid sorceress
like fire sorry
kills uh ice enemies in one damn hit
it's worth it
stop ending at things I don't want the a
mat game die oh my god for that Firebolt
powerup girl fuck this
yes more fire
no that's I can do without the key oh
fuck
come out here and fuck it there we go
duck
all right I got a chance this is not the
lowest my hopeless man I really fucked
up in one of the early levels and I
ended up with literally one hit point
for like five minutes I was running
around with one lonely head point I made
a recovery and this probably the lowest
I've been since then
all right which stage have I not done
hurt her
well that's the first one certainly done
that one oh I think it's warning me here
yeah yeah this is where I need to go I
think this is the last one for the ice
level dead in the water
oh that 52% that's that's probably
mastery which isn't the the whole game
I'm I'm skipping a lot of collectible
type stuff I'm not going for finding all
of the the hidden armor power-ups and
everything I am I am just straight-up
trying to live this is a no-frills run a
fire over ice
we need to go I don't remember
all right
fucker you fucker back I can't do not do
yes it just yeah okay I guess I just had
to go over here last he's he's busy
injustice
take your best shot
that's not dangerous to go there
see what we find see we're a magical
adventure takes us next while we're not
playing other games that apparently most
of the chat would rather I be playing
damn it lost on the connection for
shield already had fuck
firestorms killed those fucking yet
which is nice
let's kill those guys just all so nice
there at least one one regular hit not
the fancy overhead one
oh boy
all right good good and where is the key
I want to do this little platforming bit
as little as possible so I need the big
door key
then I just want to get the fuck out of
here
I'm assuming that's a joke with the FTL
no death rum because every FTL run is a
no death run I hope that's a joke either
there is a sequel to this game it is
called Maximo vs the army of Zin which
are kind of like clockwork robots it's
really fun the platforming isn't quite
as nightmarish as it is in this one
and the combat has a lot more like
combos and whatnot the combat
sorry this is gonna take a while cuz I
gotta find the big key
took the risky way down probably
shouldn't have yes two for one
I didn't need to grab that premise your
head chest
it's not the one I came from I don't
know that's where I came from god damn
it god damn it
I shouldn't jump on there I mean that's
obviously easier to jump on the wider
platforms what I'm getting impatient and
that's probably stupid
that's the door I'm gonna go for the
next time I'm gonna go that I'll go see
if I can find the key
right there
try
I soared a nice level yep the stores are
kind of random I mean there's some that
are pre place but a lot of them are
random drops from killing enemies and
even though they introduced the sword on
the ice level the day I saw it on the
ice levels the fire swords tends to be
more affected every single one of the
enemy types you encounter here
it's this what's in here what's in here
what do you got
know what I do that why not do that
we're over we're done we're done
god damn it god damn it that was dumb
that was just dumb you're all gonna see
it in a second yeah well from your point
of you saw it now because I choked
I fucking choked I choked
fuck just what it kind of got interested
I wasn't interesting before then well
fuck off
damnit I hate that what do I do now what
time is it it's 9:30
I don't know I'm think about it let me
think about it put this away
yeah take good care of my games I put
them all back in the right boxes put
everything away nicely that's how we
play with our toys
all right so you guys you guys wanna do
something else different game everybody
what game what game do you want to play
I know you guys I know you guys hated
Maximo you guys hated Maximo to death
so what well game we planned you let me
know what game we're playing
yeah I still have pretty much the
original disk for every guy in my game I
ever bought because I actually take good
care of my games
I know I know everybody earlier was
asking for FTL FTL was a big request but
people also like thee the ex comes you
know I did I did destroy one disk I had
hey it was action I write ugly I was
trying to take good care of it but I
wiped it off with the wrong type of
cloth and I got scratches all over it I
Mossad mysteries of thus it was the
expansion pack for Jedi Knight anyway
here we go different game
different game which open broadcaster is
not playing because open broadcast and
I'd open broadcaster about this capture
program which kind of sucks kind of
sucks let me see if I can get that taken
care of
apparently the capture program freaked
out because I turned the PlayStation 2
off
all right oh yeah
plug you in and unplug you for crying
out loud I don't even turn the
PlayStation 2 off I just hit were set
this capture card is thwarting me and
have returned I wonder no wonder Jack
just gave me the damn thing he bought a
new one and he gave me the old capture
card so I bought one that was a if it's
a it's a it's it's from X yeah it's from
eggs you lied to me he lied to me it's
not cool it's not cool man
okay cuz I was ex asked so nicely for a
new game here we go new game
yes I'm playing it hard
what's the angriest another rlm member
has ever made me we're good friends
anger doesn't happen often
you've probably seen that footage of me
being angry with Mike that that
Monkeyman footage where I asked Mike to
help me move that like we're moving out
on you've heard the story before maybe
something happened I'm saying most
people we were haven't heard the story
we were moving furniture out of my dead
grandmother sauce just getting rid of a
bunch of old stuff really gosh she had
this old player piano and oh Jesus fuck
was it heavy
so Mike came over to help me move the
piano out of the house and in the middle
of like a heat wave in July he asked me
put on a monkey man costume and he films
me breaking it apart with like us ledge
hammer and there's footage of this
online somewhere eventually I just
started yelling at him and it wasn't
part of any kind of script I just got
pissed at Mike and he was filming me all
while this is going on I just started
yelling at him about him making a stupid
monkey man movie so there you go that's
the most angry I've been at another rlm
member
that player piano was actually kind of
broken like a lot of the keys on it were
fucked up and it had had issues I think
this is the days before Craigslist - I
mean it would have been hard to sell
I have to go find who's doing this
right and I'll go track that girl back
to her village you must rescue those
Souls
I'm on a Crim if you need me just use
the coin Thanks are you sure I'll be
needing this oh yeah I guarantee you
will all right here we go but playing
Maximo to I don't remember half the
combos so oh well this one you can pan
around the camera which is just a
revolution
need me them points this one you
actually have to buy the upgrades you
get rather than rather than them
randomly falling out of monsters you
kill
treasure chest your cemeteries
and well this is something but this this
this game has a feature I really like
which is rescuing innocent civilians
every stage has like I forget how many
it is like four or five people who are
in danger from monsters and you have a
limited amount of time to rescue them
before the monsters get to it
that guy did not make it that's cutscene
death it's not my fault
see I rescued her then you rescued them
they give you things could be could be
coins could be set armor can be a key
shades shades of Monty Python on the
Holy Grail right there killer rabbits
this game is full of killer rabbits
and yes if you noticed I am playing it
hard
I have I have also no death run in this
game and I actually think it's harder
the platforming is actually easier
there's less of the one-hit deaf
nonsense but the combat gets kind of
chaotic and it's easy to die in combat
especially later on
and for the record I am NOT emulating
this I I kinda want to get around seeing
how well this thing emulates ps2 games
just haven't done it yet this is kind I
decided I was gonna play the Maximo
games when Jack was sick oh my god I'll
just put Maximus what I'm in the mood
for
and you don't have to worry about shield
health in this you can throw and block
with your shield as as much as you want
forever and ever
I'm used to having a mighty shield so I
keep I keep putting the shield up to
suck in coins but nothing's gonna happen
because I don't have that upgrade yet
get away from that guy he's under my
protection
god damnit you can't have him what's up
dude what's up
my brain kind of remembers some of the
combos I don't know that there's a big
list in the game that explains them
either I think you just play around with
the controls you've actually find them
all
I'm gonna go back to the armor the guy
dropped her left her told me about we're
gonna continue on I got that thing
I remember telling you guys about the
money pipeline right
does money Python now get credit for
every singer single killer rabbit that
ever shows up in any kind of medium
yeah
yeah
oh he only dropped a health fuck that
it's decent combo I wanted coin Scott
damn it
what a fucking waste here we get to the
bye-bye things face I forgot what the
best upgrade path is though I know
that's that's the combat guy who sells
the combat rooms don't hold off on this
shit until I don't remember I don't
remember what I wanted what order I want
it I'll buy that for them
thank you boy
we're getting really quiet during this
one alright I talk more during my no
death Rakesh it's kind of weird kind of
weird
you know I'm so pissed I died by that
that rookie mistake and impatience
during the ice level that was so stupid
have I gotten a chance to play
dishonored yet it's on my to-do list it
really is
what get up there I know we can get up
there there we go
which which film would you most like to
do a commentary on I know I don't know
how we even pick the movies we're going
to do commentaries on just come on let's
do this okay okay I think originally
we're gonna stick more like B movies in
there but I think the thought was that
they were harder to find than the the
major Hollywood flopper hit movies earn
bigger named movies it's like we thought
we could we could sell as a commentary
track but nobody has a fucking copy of
ZAP know where to find one
I don't have that Kiev - sure
yeah this one they changed the platform
obviously you can see you're close to
the edge you will grab on the edge
fucker
Wow good right you can see here it's
about the armored briefs you get to wear
the pink bomber and in the first game it
was kind of like a temporary
invulnerability thing and this one the
fourth layer of armor you get its
justice gold-plated stuff it's kind of
gaudy what's got a sweet
ninety-eight percent what secrets I
missed I missed a chest ah fuck
oh well Ritchie you excited for alien
500 I'll tell you if I'm excited once I
actually see more I've got a name and
the knowledge that they're making a
sequel
you know man we'll see we'll see it's
one of those things I don't I don't
necessarily know that there needs to be
more in the franchise but there will be
because you know money I get that you
stay away from that old man you robot
you kill a robot
and you stay away from that young man
so I gotta enough me to buy it
decent tack roof oh man
sir Chester oh no someone obviously you
guys don't know
yeah there
Oh
no Hubley 100% nope for anything else no
I cannot alright we're good
definitely need that might have shield
up great
keep doing that all night don't like it
look
I don't remember what button is just
something good there we go it's that you
can turn into death of this game but
there's a limited amount of time you
could be deaf
that's what collecting Souls does in
this one
thank you
more armor
cuz I need armors so much
I'm so pissed off I fundamentally it's
just stupid way it's the stupid way it
happened it was impatience that did it
no-no-no
yes it was it was platforming that
killed me I got impatient and instead of
waiting to make a slightly easier jump
by I made a difficult jump and I I made
a difficult jump too later than I should
have started maybe it was it was stupid
all around
I was like a clam Maximo - now Maximo -
is pretty fun unless you have no soul
Maximo - is horribly boring if you like
the order this game is hardly cinematic
at all
thank you guys
that's right I did not make that jump I
merely attempted it that's that's really
the problem right there
the fact that I attempted it is the
problem when I should never have
attempted that jump it was so stupid
you fucker ruining my combo half-decent
combo yet
alright alright you got a decent amount
of money out of that the higher the
combo the higher the combo the more
money enemies drop also the more blades
of grass you can cut down on one hit the
more money you get from the grass
just nope nope just in there I look like
a prime spot for just hiding
chef's got to save this story health jug
we got a mighty shield all right
what somebody subscribe yeah I can't I
can't hear these subscribers tonight we
got the audio set up so I apologize
blend Oh 75 thank you for subscribing we
really appreciated for every subscriber
we get tonight I will I will play the
Maximo cutscene
once that's promised
shit
the Maximo cutscene will will not be the
new Ishtar trailer that one's been done
to death
enough for the consoles nothing I like
to get into which consoles best your
over the other and it's punching
nonsense but I think I think the
PlayStation 2 might might be the best
console ever lot of good games came out
in this system
that said multi multi plant it's the
best way to go multi-platinum or people
get to enjoy the game this mine is
better than yours nonsense it's kind of
stupid
maybe maybe it's less to do with just
the system and more the era but lots
lots of good ps2 games no I missed it
how did I miss that
oh shit now well this is this was not
declared a node Ephraim
you know he looks it looks best about
all the fancy armor with the helmet off
and just the normal starting armor I
think I think that's the best look for
Maximo
thank you guys
which have I broken any bones or lungs
what are what are odd pairing of
questions either one on the road is a
valid enough question but why would you
why would you ask those both at once so
like what's the relation as far as laws
you know like everybody's broken a law
at some point if you've you've driven a
mile over the speed limit you've broken
a law so yeah yeah sure as far as bones
not not that I know of I know I know you
can have like little tiny fractures like
a like a break a pinkie toe or something
and and never really know it or have it
diagnosed and I've probably done that
but as far as like breaking an arm or a
leg and having a cast and having her arm
in a sling or whatever never it's never
happened yes I've jerked a lot like
downtown Chicago stupidly sometimes
thank you guys
technically saved until you talk to them
Richard tell us about your life of crime
well this one time downtown like nowhere
near the crosswalk I I ran across the
street so I get to the other side a
little bit quicker without having to
wait just just today I was driving 31
miles per hour in a 25 mile per hour
zone huh how about that shit oh oh
earlier today I had a a nightmarish time
getting this stream set up today I came
into the studio like like five thirty
thought I had plenty of time to set up
for this shit and then I come here I
hook up the computer or I I plug in the
PlayStation 2 and I realized I forgot
the goddamn capture card right
so I went home and I got the capture
card it was a pain in the butt I came
you know came the studio got set up went
back home and I got the capture card
then I got back to the studio you know I
plugged the PlayStation 2 under the
capture card then I want to test the
setup to make sure everything was
working and I realized I forgot to grab
a PlayStation 2 controller so I had to
go back to my house again to get a
PlayStation 2 controller right and at
that point I was just kind of annoyed
and I wanted to give this business over
with so when I went back home I parked
in a handicapped spot for approximately
30 seconds while I ran inside to get a
PlayStation 2 controller
I'm a fucking rebel I'm a law breaking
rebel handicap spot I don't do this shit
I don't care about them cripples man
well that combo
sweetie what do you people think of
maximo - is compared to maximum are
there any you guys out there hate that
first game but think the second one
looks better at least I'm curious at the
very least I figure the combat is more
of people's Ally
not bad could've done better but not bad
you know that's true white I deny the
existence of God and that does carry the
death sentence in some countries so I I
am a wall breaking rebel undeniable Isis
would slit my throat so fucking fast cut
my head off and make a video and follow
my family to see because you know
religion of peace I'm not gonna jump
Isis but plenty of fun plenty of fine
Muslims everyone knows I've got a beef
with religion in general I'm trying to
be less of an ass
so the first boss this game is basically
a a chicken house monster which is okay
it's kind of cool now he's just a
chicken with twin Gatling guns which
pretty badass
I want two Tyrannosaurus Rex with twin
Gatling guns in your side of her
old-timer do you have any idea where
these things are coming from looks like
I'll be paying this gear master a visit
that was easy as hell it was the first
boss of the game you know kind of a kind
of a you know ease you into it boss not
not super hard
like half remember all of the hidden
stuff is oh we're in the the haunted
woods as far as you know video game
levels go this is one of the more unique
ones you know the fire level on the ice
level you don't see the haunted Sleepy
Hollow Forest much just like
jack-o'-lanterns and haystacks it's got
a nice Halloween II feel
thank you kind sir
I say haunted forest I'm that's not an
accurate description of what I'm trying
to get a crowd it's like more of like a
Sleepy Hollow
esque fuel to it there's like
jack-o'-lanterns and very fallish kind
of feel like your standard haunted
forest it's like the trees are all bare
and black
there's I'm doing a bad job I I think
this this set of levels has a fairly
immediately summarized
Oshin that was down to the chapter then
ii was surrounded by robot bugs what a
fright if only I could find my husband I
did find this key maybe it opens
something good okay
now that other guy you saved early in
this level he says he's looking for his
wife
I feel really bad if he dies and after I
rescue her she says I'm looking for my
husband and I'm thinking oh yeah
he's dead your husband's dead ma'am I
saw his corpse eyes make sure I saved
that first guy
I shouldn't come back down here just to
kill a couple bucks now I gotta go all
the way over there
oh yeah
thank you guys
and you under our LEM watch the
zeitgeist two films I can't speak for
anybody else but I have not even heard
of them so at least as far as rich Evans
is concerned No
my cell ovaries
thank you you don't have anything I want
dude we're just gonna save it all for
the armory guy second
that's right you got a different weapon
on this game you get the the hammer as
well as the sword
don't like hammers as much right Sarge
fucking out let the right
it's a Chad flash died again
yeah it's comic books I wouldn't I
wouldn't I wouldn't be heartbroken about
it give it a week it'll never be the
same again and this character's life has
been dramatically outdid until
everything's been undone in a few months
no I don't want to charge I want to flip
do the flip which Evans do you like

fans of it you can't call them bronies

works in many levels strip club bananas
they're appealing

cutie citrus thing cue the oranges
whatever the fuck it was
it's so bizarre that name
I can't talk about black mirror Chad I
haven't seen black mirror yet any of it

fucking is better than talking about qde
oranges
