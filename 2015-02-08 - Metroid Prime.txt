turning off the subscriber bothering you
all that much I will just turn it down
so now you all have to make sure you let
me know if there is a subscriber because
I might might not hear it because I
turned off the subscriber notification
I was thinking about playing metroid
prime i really i really loved this game
when i first played it and then someone
on twitter suggested this and I said
okay I I really I really remember loving
the crap out of this game and this is a
game that I refer to a lot whenever I'm
talking to people about good use of
gameplay as a story mechanic and showing
and not telling so this is usually a go
to game that got it writes the whole
story versus gameplay stuff so oh I see
that con man 586 thank you for
subscribing I very much appreciate it
Jack hates strip clubs and farscape but
loves the interview what I think a lot
of people dislike strip clubs and for
escape you know that's just me that's
fine that's fine why am I watching a
boring cutscene that is a really
important question that is a really
important question because it's because
it's Metroid all I need to remember I
need to remember how to play this game
now oh man it has been a long time
oh great can't look up why can't I look
up that seems oh that's right that's
right you you have to like aim oh man oh
man this is great blocking on two
targets I'm ready to go tutorial Oh
scanning yes scanning I love this
I just ask an advisor
yeah so like this is the great thing
this was like central gameplay mechanic
is the scanning stuff right and it's how
you figure it's a it's how you find out
about the story it's how you find out
about unless the switches over it okay
great and it's amazing combat visor the
only problem is now my eid crocodile
brain skinnable objects appear as orange
targets this which does not seem to be
operational the control panel on the
pillar in this room can turn oh right
see it's because I wasn't paying
attention so the control panel over here
the pillar pillar over here oh oh that's
it oh man yes the pillar behind I can't
listen it takes to get my give me a
little bit here we go boom boom I want
to say there's a way to cycle targets
too that's what I want
oh of course boom boom jump make sure
you're not how to jump that's important
in any game do-do-do-do do-do-do-do like
any good metroid game starts you out
with some powers use the ABM to open
doors easy peasy easy motherf love and
PZ does this look weird on your screen
does it look smushed ok right i just
learned that about opening doors scan
that beach
great open open great dogs and Jack
can't look up right big run is saying
he's not too familiar with stream cell
phone wants to know my setup for
streaming console games so right now i
have my gamecube hooked up to my capture
device which is a hauppauge HPR i want
to say it's hbr a hauppauge captured
device nice and it is a to do the dev
severe spinal injury I don't know it's
what we use to record gameplay footage
it was incredibly large muscle structure
surrounding the jaw area oh no it's what
i'm using right now my gamecube so my
gamecube is plugged into the hauppauge
which is running to the hajj capture
software on my computer and then i'm
using OBS open broadcaster software to
capture the little window that apagas
streaming into to streaming it out to
you guys the alp hog was relatively
inexpensive and the OBS is free obvious
is a free broadcasting software which is
great and that's what we use and i use
my hauppage a lot for like i said not
only for streaming but also this is
probably where I came in this where I
came in this feels like where I came in
this is definitely where I came in not
for streaming but also for recording
gameplay footage for the show works
great for consoles has RGB in component
in and HDMI through which is incredibly
helpful so like for example when we're
applying a ps4 game or
or or anything like that the hdmi threw
in a yellow goober LD you in a little
goober the HDMI through means that the
issue of my past or means that we can
play live and it still records without
any space crisis cool cool space pirates
yeah it's cool
right
can I is so here's a question level one
of the game can I figure out where to go
probably this way oh yeah okay it's very
strange not oh he looks still alive oh
hey he's still shooting at me get out of
here you jerk I was scanning you because
he's shooting me what a dillweed so
Gibby I don't this is the only capture
device I've ever used so I cannot tell
you if this is better or worse than any
other capture device ah it works it
works for us it's the the only thing
weird is the the software side of things
can be wonky sometimes
and so I feel like that is a door that I
don't know okay I got through that you
would think that this is the thing you
couldn't pass through so the software
side of things is wonky sometimes and I
try actually not to use hauppauge
capture I used a different software
that's a little bit older in a little
bit wonky er to actually capture
approved I actually I use OBS a lot too
what is this platform active great to
capture stuff because I find it simpler
so the actual device is very nice and
like I said that pass through is super
convenient but the software that you
need to run with it is that is the real
problem with the hauppauge looks like
Liza okay great shit
oh right morph ball more fault I
remember what's that oh ah dick
that there we go so I remembering how to
play the game doing away with club
nintendo North America oh I didn't know
that did I ever owned any pogs that's a
weird question probably at some point
listen we all we all had pogs right
that's just a oh shit
space pirate what about you orbs I
remember most of this stuff I remember
most of this it has been a incredibly
long time since I've played this game
guys I will be very very honest with you
mara Mara I am I'm you know I've got
four for those of you who don't know for
a while I did you know for a couple
weeks I did solo streams by myself fire
missiles well why do i do I need to fire
missiles Oh probably that thing there we
go yeah I did silver streams for a while
by myself and you know did fine I
thought and then rich started joining in
for hack and a half whoa
which I thought it's great and it's
always had it's always fun to have
someone to bounce off of as far as as
far as actually entertaining you guys is
concerned so you know I I do miss that
not having someone to bounce off of I've
gotten kind of used to that and so
preparation oh please step into the
hologram so just having to talk to
myself here is a little rough but I'm
sure I'll figure it out again man so
many things to scan I don't know this is
just me but like I definitely I
definitely feel compelled to just scan
absolutely everything in this game and I
don't know why that is like I don't know
like if it's just because like it is a
choice you know it's it's it's not
integral to the game it's it's a choice
and so because it's my choice and
because like I know I don't know I don't
know what makes this more compelling
than other scanning mechanics or if it
even is more compelling i think is more
compelling
oh here it is here's the elevator thingy
I'm compelled to scan all the things
there's the oh damn you
get out of here you big what is that who
that I really need to deal with these
pirates before I go scanning everything
now get out of here
okay all right that's for real and if I
remember correctly I can just go like
this and that these things come to me
yes ok back to scanning don't mind me
just scanning see I like this you know
like figuring this out for myself this
is like some sort of every specimen we
will have a document of every specimen
ended in the universe I kind of like
that sets up the mood right
who dat are you alive cuz I will kill
you acid burns I'm gonna kill you I
don't care if you have acid burns who
who's firing at me mutagen tank okay
great let's get out of here it's really
upsetting to me not having control for
anyone who doesn't know I don't have
control over look I can base it movement
and turning is one big thing I don't
have I don't have any strafe right now
which is really upsetting for someone
who's used to playing more modern
first-person shooters great great so
like the even though the game who hasn't
little yellow stick i can't i can't look
around i suppose i only have access to
strafe like i don't have access to it
looking around and so if i want to look
up or down i have to lock my legs which
is fairly annoying hey don't mess up my
scanning space pirate
I was right in the middle of scanned
some shit you just jump in there like a
big goober ah of course because of
course it's a Metroid game somehow these
aliens designed giant metal spheres as
keys knowing full well that one of their
greatest adversaries turns into a giant
metal sphere
yeah I see something holding L will let
you strength right so holding out lets
you strafe but then you can't look up or
down and you can't look left to right
and if you hold are you can look around
but then you can't walk there's no
there's no in-between and it's
infuriating if you've ever played a real
FPS just just infuriating we're gonna
let it go because it was a different
time but still he's insert metallic
sphere haha come on scan and all the
shit subject looks like it's been
partially eaten what when I come from I
came from there today yes superbad a
save station the hose were the days a
real FPS like Call of Duty right sorry
not a real FPS yes that was mean of me
that was very that it was mean of me to
say real FPS in more modern FPS is in pc
FPS is that's that's what i really meant
to say this is not something that you
would find in a pc FPS which was a
little snobbish of me nope that's my
missile it's not wish of me and I
apologize
right and of course all you guys are you
saying you know why would you ever use a
controller and a real FPS but I disagree
with you and whatever that's fine
everything's fine you're right you're
right scarf that something rich would
say
try not to be so bitchy but it comes out
sometimes
scan the enemy to find its weak point
genetically enhanced by unknown means a
weak spot has been detected in this
creatures mouth use your auto targeting
to acquire a new target great great
get real now guys
this is getting a little real
all right let's get it to death right
right
but you know it's it's part of the game
scanning
being aware of your surroundings like
that's part of your job is is you know
you're figuring out the I don't even
know what this story of this game is
should also pay more attention to my
health bar jump button to dodge while
strafing Thank You CG lover
it also it does yes this game also has
jumping puzzles which are one hundred
percent out of place oh shit evacuating
evacuating oh it's gonna
thank you all those like I do kind of
love the jumping puzzles in this because
they are so difficult ended there's a
way to look at it more fun which is like
if you're in this super amazing battle
suit shit what is that am I stuck on now
whatever gave you I'm getting out here
jesus H Christ
this creature is deceased well fucking
death how do I get out of here now
yeah die kill it with fire
I kind of love your limited movement
because it adds to the tension so much
and you know you're in this bulky space
armor shit I don't care about you watch
me not care about your bugs but open
obviously I'm way wrong about this but I
still glad I was fun i also just don't
remember i'm probably going to get to
some of these jumping puzzles and just
give up because it's so awful so mark my
words now i'm saying i like it now but
I'm probably one hundred percent
incorrect okay oh my god I got to leave
these bugs alone these bugs are doing me
no good
also right now I'm a little annoyed at
how much screen my gun is taking up coop
there we go which I suppose is the
balance for you know like when I'm
charging like this just takes a ton of
space which I guess is the bounds for
having such a powerful weapon activated
which I get get it
No
hmm I have all this time I'm running I'm
in the game I'm into the game guys
you and not quite sure what the purpose
of those bugs are except for to annoy me
they are doing that open up door there's
probably like a phase 2 to the boss
fight that I am unaware of at the moment
well excuse me oh my gonna die no yes
did I die no okay I'm fine I'm fine
I'm with it I am a hip and I am with it
making this work for me I'm hip and
with-it open up thank you and and
remember you guys might not remember how
awesome samus looks when this game came
out this was not a normal thing this was
the first 3d Samus game already good old
Ridley gobbledygook says Jack do you
consider Nintendo to be your favorite
brand of video game companies
you know yeah I mean I guess just by the
fact that almost by default yes great
lately no lately no but overall yes that
is what I will say great got a scan guys
lately Nintendo has not made anything
great say yes or else various email
morphol oh yes here it is all the stuff
malfunctions someone pasted for me like
what the story of this game is because
I've already forgotten
I lost
I lost i'm kinda lost
am i morph ball malfunction oh here we
go okay nine is sickening walking like
this
space pirates as bad is it was
depressurizing come on jerks
the only yeah oxygen here who said that
ncc-1701 the only reason I care about
Nintendo moments because the new zelda
right the only route so the only reason
we care about Nintendo anymore is
because of old life geez they are still
coasting off of old love which is fine
that's fine and acceptable as long as I
keep making good stuff but
they haven't made anything they haven't
made anything new or interesting in a
while and their business that's fun does
this game even have Metroid's in it it
does it does tracking an enemy target
has been lost ground-based recon
required yes but splatoon right there's
platoon
you know there there have been companies
that have done more there have been
companies that have made games that I've
liked more in recent years there have
been companies that have made platforms
that I like even more valve and so
there's a lot there's a lot more out
there nintendo will always have a place
nintendo will always have a place
yeah this is I'm
it says azam does the screen look funny
to you like does it look so much does it
look smushed in four by three are you
guys fine with it and look it feels
funny to me can I go to our or my
options here we go
if I stretch it that does that look
better to you guys if I stretch it out
like this you tell me captain yeah you
say it looks so much the first time it
feels smushed okay here this should look
better
my eyes are opposite he down a little
bit he'd system well what was it I don't
know great what are you thoughts in a
radio shack right and system off yeah uh
what are my thoughts on radio shack I
think like many of us i was now i was
gonna make the joke that everyone makes
which is that i was surprised they were
in business to begin with but i actually
use radio shack a lot I'm you know so
I'm a little Oh get out here I'm a
little bummed that they filed for
bankruptcy I didn't hear the rumor that
Amazon is looking at buying them up just
to get their retail locations which
would be awesome
to make amazon shippings faster and
smoother here we go there's a dar
alright so the metroid game begins let
the metroid hang begin so many things to
metroid look at that metroid Jesus
Christ scan it scan it with fire new
creature entry has been downloaded to
your logbook beetle this is a beta shit
get out of here
damn vital eat damn vital all right um
so yeah radio shack I might have been
one of the few people who actually like
went to radioshack er like semi normally
normally semi-regularly open up that's
where I came from right so but obviously
I didn't go there often enough nor did
anyone for them to be a viable business
but I do I will if they close down other
stores i will miss them because often i
would just need a weird connector or
weird adapter that you know same day and
of course you can get any connector any
adapter at any time or you can get any
advanced training connector but not same
day and that's the big difference buy
anything for amazon but
killed it I killed it killed it with
fire fire fire fire set fire to your
face on fire set fire to the world on
fire guys like blood brothers yeah me
too also if you didn't I'm cool with
that where are these things can I shoot
them why can I can shoot them that's
that's fantastic news shoot all the
things I fuck you think Jack did you
play for the whole metro metroid prime
trilogy yes yes I did ages ago you know
when they first came out I have not
played them recently and I did not play
the re-release when they rereleased the
whole trilogy on the wii i did not play
that giving them all the wii controls i
did not yeah because i was so he's
playing this like the wii controls were
fine but as Jack talked about the zelda
netflix thing that probably isn't true
well no it's true zelda is talking with
Nintendo about making a Zelda a
live-action Zelda series for netflix
exclusive the thing we don't know yet
hold on for a second Oh laughter Sam the
thing we don't know is if it's going to
happen it is true that they're talking
with them but basically the announcement
is that Netflix is pitching Nintendo and
of course Nintendo is very apprehensive
after the Super Mario Brothers movie so
it's quite possible that nothing is
going to happen but
oh we don't know Zelda is talking with
Nintendo is that what I said Netflix is
talking with Nintendo Jack talks
sometimes and sometimes even it makes
sense oh I already got you
hmm I am kind of kind of in love with
this it's probably it's mostly probably
nostalgia it's it's one hundred percent
nostalgia why I'm so in love with this
but I'm kind of in love with this Zelda
anime with cowboy beeble level are to
come someone is saying Zelda anime with
cowboy bebop level art that would be
that would be really nice but I could
also see it going live action you know
they were calling it or they were
describing it as kind of a game of
thrones but for the whole family and I
think that would be awesome I think that
fantasy in general is something that is
not seen it's not seen too much on TV
right now passageway to shrine good to
know Jojo what's over here
is that what are you oh that's right i
don't have my charge beam to trying to
use my charge beam what are you you're a
thing to a place ah and so i could see
that being the pitch you know with the
game of thrones being as hot as it is
right now it's like a full family a
family friendly game of thrones a kid
adventure look at that shit that's
awesome what is that
I am getting through these lasers like a
mother fucking pro he's got through all
those lasers as it turns out I'm pretty
awesome I don't know if you knew this
about me but I am pretty awesome here we
go to chose allure we chose our
departing now after so many years in
peaceful seclusion here until on for
when we came hell this place was a
refuge for our spirits the civilization
built from native materials bereft of
the trappings of our technology we will
link to the land here kindred to the
plants and the animals far away from
machines we had become so dependent on
and so we leave it now pristine a
testament to the more forms we no longer
need we have drawn the veils of time and
space as I and I was drawing beyond the
illusion but we will never forget this
the most sacred of our homes and we were
main ever watchful that's one you know
that is that's fun what's that purple
thing
you look like a thing
okay fuck yeah I hear you fucks alright
flying enemies I remember flying enemies
being the worst having to look up in
general just the worst I don't know
where I'm going that's the thing you
should know about me right now just kind
of playing playing the game you're a
thing that's chozo sculpture creature
has been downloaded into my log
out of here get out of here good
everybody's out of here and jump hey
great ok get your shows Oh gowron's
there's a save point back there is there
back where how far away am i from it I
need a save point because I can only
assume some biggs if you're if you're
telling me that there's a save point
that means that there's something
important coming up because there's a
point in here Oh was it one of those
other doors out here see I'm all of
interest in the save point I should have
just kept going I'm going to stop
listening to you guys now my energy is
low and there's the thing like over here
see god damn it god fucking dammit cat
kept fucking damn it
I shouldn't have listened to you told me
to go back to a safe point this is the
lesson I've learned I was doing really
good i thought uh Anna dead that's fine
this isn't a no death run or anything
I'm just playing and then you tell me
what the save point I stopped caring
true thing everything that happened no
that's where I came from this way new
game no no I'm I'm just playing I'm just
playing and enjoying playing in and join
doo doo doo killing all the Beatles doo
doodoo brain and enjoy an aquiline all
the Beatles you know those needles what
am I even talking sometimes sometimes I
am
great see how they reinforced and
scanning because scanning is important
to the story and so they make you scan
things every once in a while just to
remind that you they can scan things so
you can scan all the enemies and scan
the lore that's really nice a mosquito
murder mm-hmm murdered a mosquitoes up I
don't even care what a skittle is I'll
murder it I don't even know if those are
skittles I'll murder anything I'm
fucking Samus Aran I'm murder anything
for the good you think I should serve
referring to myself in the third person
for the good of his dream sometimes I do
that usually I only do that like in my
head I do that in case someone is
confused as to who's talking like if
it's me and rich and Jay you know you
know who we are but you're just hearing
our voices and so really I just do that
to make sure that you know that it's Oh
door cannot be opened with that weapon I
don't have a home oh my pan was going
the right way were you dingleberries
lying to me about there being a safe

what else are you going to talk about
what else happened this week we talked
about radio shack already I feel what
else you know what I can talk about you
know what I can talk about this weekend
was a heavy kids movie weekend as you
all know I have children and so you know
sometimes we want to move me sometimes
we don't this weekend we watched two
movies we've watched the boxtrolls and
the book of life and I was actually
pretty excited to see the boxtrolls
because I know it was nominated for Best
Animated Feature not like that matters
cuz I don't really care about awards but
I was definitely interested in seeing it
and I had also heard great things and it
is boxtrolls is very food at box feels
very good really fun
we are you there really fun little movie
stop motion claymation adorable style
really really adorable style fuck you
fuck you and it looks great and the
boxtrolls highly recommend did vaccinate
my kids god damn right I vaccinated my
kids facts and he's got damn kids I'll
start an ad campaign called don't be a
dick vaccinate your kids now boxtrolls
super cute super cute and super fun had
a really good time kids seem to enjoy it
a couple scary moments a couple like
really weird moments for it being a kids
movie you know specifically like I guess
you know what I'm gonna I want to throw
this out there I'm going to throw the
spoiler alert for boxtrolls if you if
you're interested boxtrolls don't listen
for the next couple minutes that I
suppose I the it there was a reveal
later on that the villain dumpy take
vaccinate your kids that's right the
villain is a cross dresser and so like
just very strange segments for for it
being a children's film but it's fine
and a really fun little movie the
boxtrolls a little light a little you
know like I we talked about this when I
when I talked about um big hero 6 you
know like definitely kind of
waivers on the size of just a kid's
movie but still very fun very fun a date
then we also saw the book of life I
don't know if you guys know anything
about that but it was produced by
guillermo del toro that's very exciting
as i generally enjoy at least his ideas
if not all of all of all of his movies
but produced by gamma overdose or has a
really interesting look to it it's it's
animated 3d animated and all of the
characters look as if they are kind of
marionettes they're like wooden puppet
look to them ah one of the gist dullest
stories are we getting the morph ball
already is this happening already it was
QE book of life or was it called no I
was because book of life book of light
looks really cute really cute but just
an incredibly dull and and needlessly
stretched out story there were
characters that had no place in the
story there was like love triangles on
top of personal issues there was like
inter there was a there was like modern
songs done in quasi mariachi style not
even mariachi said which is slightly
like Spanish style it was very
distracting I really did not like
overall I did not much care for a book
of life it was fine for a kids movie and
of course in typical kids movie faction
my kids loved it and I was like you want
to watch boxtrolls again and there's a
no it's why the book of life again I was
like get out of here with that but
that dash that's incredibly helpful good
there ah it was just like this crazy
complicated story there's crazy
complicated stories and four characters
that deserve no complication if that
makes any sense come on get out here I
can get serpentine they're real oh I
don't have my chai keep I keep trying to
charge up my blaster and I don't have it
I don't have my charge less oh there you
go can't take none of this Samus you
should see Paddington is batshit crazy
hahaha you hated pans lambarth you were
wrong slide down pan's labyrinth is
great you are dead wrong get out of here
with that
no it's uh yeah book of life polyus just
didn't didn't much care for it it was it
was too that was two kids movie II where
they didn't they weren't necessarily
paying attention to like pacing or
character development it was all just
you know what what ship can we get on
the screen now to keep the kids watching
gotta keep the kids interested looks
like it should be something right that's
fun can I jump no I can't jump great
what's the best TMNT incarnation
tellegen asked i really like the new
Nickelodeon show i'm going to say the
best TMNT incarnation is this new
Nickelodeon show it's it's fun it's
lights the the turtles are actually
different characters they look different
the animations a little a little long
but you know for the budget you know
like for example even though they live
in new york city new york city seems to
consist of one street and a population
of zero whenever they leave the sewers
but you know there's actual
characterization in it which is very fun
and finally someone gets splinter right
which is you know he's a real ninja
master i really really like the new
nickelodeon animated incarnation of the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles I don't you
know and and I guess I've never read the
original Turtles comic so I can't
comment if that's better or not
apologies if it is better twelve year
when Jack works for Nickelodeon now
isn't there there's like a Nickelodeon
animator that comes in here every once
in a while I want to say right see
cartoon network oh I can't do this yet
there's like a there's like a charge up
thing that you get later
remember that but I can't do it yet I
know that much Sarah there might be a
thing over here I mean there's that
obviously I remember what I have to do
is that true Nickelodeon TMNT is the
best thing a lethal ninja master yeah
splinter in the in the Nickelodeon
cartoon is is great
he actually you know and you know why
he's great cuz he does something like in
the movie or in the old cartoon he was
just there he didn't do anything and he
didn't do anything because they couldn't
figure out how to get his puppet to look
good um but here he does stuff he is
integral to the stories its sponsors
nice in the in the Nickelodeon cartoon
gotta go round all right a time and I
will remember to save here I remember if
I if you go through this area there was
that there's a tunnel that was like
there seems to be a hole over here
that's weird Oh over here so that's
where I'm going um Pete and Pete best
ever you know there was some good stuff
in Pete and Pete for when you're younger
for when you're younger the new team and
t is like Teen Titans yeah yeah little
the definitely you know they it's not
not quite aping off of anime but they're
taking some style elements from anime
exaggerating and I like that I I'm okay
with all of that and it's fun they keep
it fun I think that's important
it's weird that like a Kids program
would want to be fun I was out the other
day and we saw me and me and my my
six-year-old were out and he saw a DVD
cover of the Michael Bay ninja turtles
and and we're at a store and he as loud
as you can just goes you it's the ugly
Ninja Turtles like he's seen you know
advertisements for those ninja turtles
and all I can say is like why do they
look so ugly and I can't answer him it's
just like I have no idea why they look
so ugly and so he makes sure just to say
II as loud as again every time he sees
them because they look so ugly and I all
I can do is agree well that's all i can
do is agree with them they look ugly it
makes me proud it makes me very proud
okay come on get down there
my son is a episode yes I'm training I'm
training him to be a hipster I'm trying
to try to train him to have good taste
warrior
Boing see what's in here see if there's
like a save spot in here that's the
thing later I remember that you get like
a magnetic morph all right get out of
here
ya hear ok I got a game you know what
I'm gonna get out of here how about that

sounds great whatever it is it's a world
of Wizarding wizards who is the
wonderful whiz boom boom boom comic-con
pretty much yeah that's what I thought
I never you know what I saw a couple
episodes of the Star Wars someone asked
if I yes I say yes because like I just
remembered like you can steam up your
visor and I think that's awesome someone
just asked if I ever watched the star
wars clone wars animated stuff and I saw
a couple episodes and I thought the
animation was so ugly that I couldn't
watch it I could not bear to watch it I
do I don't care if it's good it was so
ugly to look at that I just could not
stand it I just was right where am I
going

totally stuck in H point to 64
which is fine it's a fight that's a fine
code act and now with with more html5 we
should be seeing that was kind of dumb
an appreciative no structural weakness
detected in metalwork that's your
scanning the new chose allure and tree
has been downloaded to your book as we
struggle with the great poison something
stirs at the edge of our vision it is in
the hatchling sabes we feel her across
the void as she hunts the corrupted will
our fates again be one as our pride
chatters will prophesy become real when
all strength wanes from chozo will it be
the hatch league who fulfills our legacy
true sight eludes us for the poison
gnaws at all vision leaving Sears wide
and filled with despair truth blessings
baked up later funny voices for the wind
be like this yeah I I like to picture
that the chozo as nerds because they are
there technologically advanced there's
nerds I probably can't step in that goo
it's my guess
so I'm not killing those things because
they're giving me light and I want that
light so i won't step in the goo there

shadow of debris over land within the
violence of its it back through though
we perceived this for beyond space time
it was but a curiosity a brief flare in
the infinite March of the universe but
the meteor brought with it corruption
the great poison burst forth visible and
clawing out life was such violence that
we were ripped from our peaceful state
and follow the shadows of a portal for
vilified searching for why we are here
that turned into a little Cosby little

me and the amount of my knowing it's not
it's not several platforms in the other
room oh oh oh I see
platforms are moving
are they not moving anymore did I run
out of juice anymore juice
I can give you juice absol
I took too long the platform's forgot
how to move

constraint anymore but I could be been
in that door before I have I think

anything is possible
you know like there's like a hidden
thing here
I have to remember how this work so it's
like here then another one and then no
one up here here another one I want up
here

have a pair of 8-inch platform boots for
some reason oxygen a what how how could
how is that comfortable

sure it looked ridiculous but how is
that comfortable
I could even get along and get around in
that oh thank you leftover beefcake
shucks test Chuck's tests thank you for
subscribing I really appreciate it thank
you very much
whoo there was a thing in there I just
don't play yeah okay what do I need to
do now time is it it's almost 11:00 guys
probably gonna ramp this up in a like a
half an hour just wanna let you know
that solid three hours
I was dreaming Metroid Prime I hope
everyone realizes what an amazing game
this is because it is enough said
let's go
and I want to say that a lot of my
Planes Trains employ heads what are you
talking about put the thing in the thing
of course I want to say that a lot of my
praises you know like whatever video
game talk would come up and we always
talked you know he eventually the topic
of a video game that got it right would
uh would come up I would always point to
Metroid Prime and I think dicks I think
I think that I'm right I think that I
was correct in my assessment that indeed
oh shit that was a dumb idea that indeed
Metroid Prime got it right for a lot for
a lot of this a lot of this is really is
really fluid and you know we have a
couple cutscene not not even cutscenes
like a couple a couple moments that kind
of take you out of of Samus about the
very short and
and so far there have been no real
cutscenes you know where Samus is
talking to someone and you're really
just not playing anything all story is
is all internal here which is great you
just cover things at your own pace the
story is optional I think that's an
important I think that's an important
point it's like discovering the story is
optional it's a little this is a little
more linear than I remember it being you
know like there's definitely a proper
order to do things not saying that's
necessarily a good or bad thing it's
just yet as compared with Super Metroid
everyone remember Super Metroid it's a
lot more linear which is fine which is
fine they're different games different
games for different times can this be
open with this one
why are you ignoring olive oil because I
haven't seen boyhood I've noticed that
every months mentioning boy I did but I
have not seen boyhood great
so I cannot unfortunately I can't join
in on your boyhood miss because I have
not seen the greatest movie made in our
generation Harlem were friends yes I
know where my children are Metroid Prime
does it's it's this is a really fun game
I wish in a perfect world we could get
Metroid Prime on a PC like we we could
get this with a little bit better
controls the controls are little their
little jank in a perfect world this
could be on PC it is still active great
I don't remember if we if the wii
controls were any good I can't imagine I
just can't imagine they were that much
greater but I'm already like I'm you
know just a couple hours in them
definitely
the controls are best done we know you
know I it could be I just I don't
remember pointing the Wiimote at the TV
for long stretches I believe it oh
that's right okay though that thing okay
I think that would be a hard part is
pointing the Wii mode at the screen for
long stretches but listen it's this is
nice this is a nice and I'm definitely
like I've grown acclimated to the weird
controls a lot faster than I thought I
would I really thought that this was
going to be a a rougher we a rougher
game than it has been so
you know you definitely get used to the
locked-down aiming and the only strafe
only strafe when you get out I know I
know shit shit shit
everything's fine anything sighs tell me
about it everything's fine everything's
fine can we bring back HR jokes
the very next comment is boyhood three
two three four four two three oh man
these men will be these men will be
hailed as Oscar winners how about that
new iPad head back that jingle head back
this way looks like we're coming to a
thing there's a thing I see a thing
gonna do a thing you know what whoa whoa
let's thing it up whoa whoa dang it up
nope
I bet samus does that all the time is
what well I think we've discussed
whether or not a shower is really that
bad and I think the general consensus is
it can't be it can't be as bad as we're
all imagining because it was such a
notorious flop
why do we have to do here oh that's
right that's right oh my god of course
this is the whole thing I've been
waiting for this
well you're right and frog in front of
me so Ron I think I got to earlier so I
think I need one more runic symbol fuck
you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck all
of you fuck you
yeah for you to be aiive
great great you gotta find that last
runic symbol tell you
shit fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
fuck fuck fuck did I mention that this
could use some better controls fuck fuck
fuck fuck fuck fuck
god fucking fuck fuck dammit fuck damn
fuck damn fuck okay I've already
activated that runic the symbol great ah
damn it
could use some better controls at the
time when this was all we had
oh man I say that as if we did also
didn't have amazing PC first-person
shooters at the time but in any case in
any case
yeah I think I see you guys talking
about like J and Mike's opinion on
boyhood yeah they never like they never
bash it they just said it was kind of
boring which Richard Linklater also said
I don't think it's any I don't think
it's any surprise that it's kind of a
bland film it is what it is and am I
looking for here runic symbol missing
one missing a runic
walls have considerable Oh haters and it
did great it's very boring right it's
very boring and but but like it's also
like it's his kind of movie which can be
boring but it took 12 years to think and
so and you know I think the problem is a
lot of people are getting caught up on
this whole 12 years to make thing which
it doesn't matter how long it takes to
make a movie all that matters is the
movie right what do we say space cop is
gonna space cop is taking seven years to
make that means it's gonna be almost as
good as Boyd
you heard it here for a space cop almost
as good as Boyett campy as good boy it
took 12 years to me space cowboy I took
said
all the things and how to hear all these
things
oh here we go and boss and boss here we
go
boring it goes good or bad well no it's
I mean boring can be good boring can be
bad I don't think it's definitive
the central nervous system is located at
the base of this structure okay great
should probably skin
like flower guy this your plan is the
source of toxic water in the roads
pharkas growth cycle those barracks
exhilarated as a result air requires
their Kazakh exposure to solar energy to
remain active this exposure has made
flowers outer shell thick and durable as
low root systems it's up for negative
honourable however exploit this flaw
when possible comes right weapon fire a
day isn't for short periods okay so
here's the question you you get badass
samus armor right super badass samus
armor you can shoot missiles in your
missile gun thing I have to shoot these
things would be my guess you get super
badass missiles and armor that lets you
roll into a ball and like fucking walk
and lava and double jump right oh here
we go
there we go I see I found it but every
time you scan something and you have to
scan things in order to figure it out
you hear that voice is it worth it
is it worth it for the super badass
armor if you have to hear that voice
this is this is the important question
I'm gonna go ahead and say no oh maybe
I'm gonna go ahead and say maybe
okay now what do I have to do I need to
pay attention he falls down do I shoot
his face
maybe not his face
don't necessarily know what to do after
I shoot down the thing so that's gonna
be
I said something gets exposed when he
falls down oh we gonna oh oh okay oh
that's it okay that's it there we go
there we go we figured it out mom I'll
just figure it out great
oh you there the great jobs boosts your
eyes inspired and that's what you hear
every time you you like have this badass
fight with like an alien
Scyther worm you hear like your chozo
friends be like Oh Salle's you're the
strongest said the best thank you so
much for protecting the universe
think there we go is it worth it is it
worth it to be the badass space hunter
pirate if you hear that voice all time
I'm gonna say yeah worth it oh hey now
hey now
this is much faster
ow ow ow what the frig man
how did you get back up already needed
Tim nope nope nope
what is going on here with all these
okay okay it's gonna move faster fuck
you Scyther
he looks like a poke of ideas either
mikeycal you upside there okay got a
stun them first then hit one thing and
come over here and hit another thing is
what I'm assuming
okay so now two of them are down so now
this thing goes away
fuck you hit me when you go away okay
we've talked about I always we've talked
about my favorite Pokemon for a while I
always have a soft spot for poison-type
pokémon I don't know why and they're
they're weak against so many things but
I love poison-type pokémon I think
they're cool
yeah I think they're super dope and
co-op
I know my Energy's low I know I'm gonna
die I'm probably gonna die
like I do I got
I move slightly faster in my ball form
so I gotta
okay movin
oh that's right I have fucking missiles
I forgot that it missiles I'm a dweebus
if it's three I got it is it three is
the three did I get it dick I forgot I
forgot that I have missiles I know I see
I see the chat now I forget I shit
there's another one oh there's energy
though there's Energon cubes
I'll get those Energon cubes fuck didn't
do me just good nope nope did I that I
died he got me somehow damn it when was
my life save too long ago probably when
was my last save

all three prime games for ten bucks all
guys that worth it Jack sorry for asking

game I mean I there was a bunch I really
enjoyed prime Luigi's Mansion I think
was a really underrated launch title a
really fun game really interesting you
know I really like that what else was
like there are so many cubes Super Mario
Sunshine is something that comes up in
chat a lot like rich and I will talk
about our love of Super Mario Sunshine
and how for some reason people hate it
on Super Mario Sunshine but that was
just the goddamn best game so many cube
games are great they just there weren't
there weren't enough of them you know
and and the ps2 and the Xbox were out
there just weren't enough cube games for
it to be successful and fortunately but
Oh spore what Luigi's Mansion was
totally fun Pikmin I never really got
into I never really got into Pikmin I
want to try that again I do want to try
it there there's the new Pikmin for Wii

Wind Waker it and Wind Waker were rushed
in half finished
you are wrong bleeped Jax sunshine and
Wind Waker are fantastic games Wind
Waker particularly I'm sure the HD
remake is even better but Wind Waker is
a beautiful one of my favorite Zelda
games Wind Waker is could be my most
favorite Zelda game I think it's
beautiful I think it's beautiful and
wonderful you were a Nintendo fan during
the bit Wars Jack I mean yeah usually I
also for a while I didn't have a
Nintendo system and so I just kind of
wished I did I had we had like the weird
Genesis and Saturn's and
HG windwaker is the most beautiful is
the most beautiful I don't I don't know
why sunshine got a bad rap either it was
because it was different you know it was
easy to make fun of because you were you
know a janitor because you can end up
the goop but I really loved the sunshine
I thought it was I thought it was great
