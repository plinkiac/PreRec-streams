...for some versatility in the streaming.
This is gonna be my surprise.
I was gonna switch games mid-stream.
That was gonna be my surprise.
But, apparently, when you switch games while streaming, it just ends the stream.
It just ends the stream.
Yeah, The Last of Us.
That was my, that was my Christmas present to you motherfuckers.
I've got The Last of Us.
Merry, merry fucking Christmas
You got, you got punked, and I got punked, cuz I didn't expect the broadcast to stop.
That's bullshit.
All right.
So, I think, obviously, because I'm doing this story-heavy game, I might not be talking that much tonight.
But, everybody wanted to see me stream The Last of Us.
Play The Last of Us, play The Last of Us!
So here we are.
And there we go.
I'm hitting a button.
What is all this shit?
What's Left Behind?
I dunno, I guess Left Behind's a thing.
I have no idea what it is.
I've never played this game before.
Left Behind is DLC.
Okay.
There's smoke happening.
Is this part of the game?
What is this smoke?
Oh, no.
They're spores.
Are there spore monsters?
I'm assuming those are spores.
Do I have to hit a button?
Do I have to hit a button, or is this, is this deliberate?
Because I don't want to skip a cutscene.
I'm supposed to be enjoying this game.
Okay.
Is that the girl?
And that's the dude.
Yes, this girl is destined to die.
Gotta, gotta fire up that schmaltz, that shmaltzy emotion.
That's fine.
All right.
Where do I turn on your, your captions here?
There you go.
There's your captions.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, I'm playing The Last of Us.
In the card, she writes "You're never around"?
What kind of fucking birthday card, let's see, dad, you're never around, please feel guilty when I die.
Jesus Christ.
Happy birthday, you're a rotten father!
But I love you anyway.
Was this girl's mother, like, really good at guilt trips?
Why don't you just...call your dad.
Everybody who told me this isn't like The Order, I'm, I'm hitting button prompts an awful lot, and I'm not really playing a game.
Turn on the lights.
Turn on, you're not turning on the lights.
Okay.
Infected maniacs ravaging town, right?
Something like that.
Oh, yeah, here we go.
Admittance spikes at area hospitals.
There we go.
Mysterious infection.
The seeds are sown.
And that's fine.
That's just an observation, not a complaint.
You see, the sewing the seeds is a fine thing.
Let's watch this.
What.
This is neat.
All right, so what am I supposed to frob?
Frob's a Thief thing.
You wouldn't know.
I got to answer the phone.
But, but I never checked the phone!
I, I didn't answer the phone.
What happened with the phone?
Why do I have two different buttons that focus on story moments?
Wow.
Heartless prick.
Whoops.
Oh, not supposed to go that way.
I'm sure if I try, I'll just get a game over, right?
Alley.
It's gonna work out just fine.
Oh, my god, predictable ambush.
Oh, he's a zombie, too.
I was, I was turning around.
I was waiting for the zombie to attack the guy crawling out of the ambulance.
That wasn't stupidity.
The first one, I wasn't sure I could die in this section.
I wanted to see the zombie.
The second time, I just wanted to see the guy get eaten.
It didn't work out.
Is that Robin Atkin Downes?
Probably.
He's, he's in every game.
He's the guy who plays Travis Touchdown.
You could have just told him to turn away.
No, I'm here.
I'm gonna be quiet because I've, I've never played this before.
This is all new to me.
Oh, my god.
Twenty years later.
That's a long-ass time.
We gotta get that Robert, I think.
Yes, this is my first playthrough.
No, I did not cry.
It was fine.
Emotions!
Emotions!
I'm not trying to hate anything.
I always make  jokes.
That's the point, that's the whole point of this.
I make jokes.
What do I think?
I haven't done much so far.
All right, is, is this my turn to walk?
I'm assuming it's my turn to walk.
I've never played any of the Uncharted games.
How do I duck again?
All right.
Bind up your wounds with a health kit.
Using a health kit takes time.
Make sure you are in a safe place.
Equip and hold R2.
Okay, okay.
What if I don't want to use it?
Do I have to use it?
Stop using it.
Un-, unuse health kit.
All right, there we go.
Oh, I have to.
All right.
Am I sick?
I guess I'm sick.
How do I duck?
It's like I'm pulling back on the stick.
It's not a duck.
Oh, great.
A vital gameplay mechanic, and I don't know how to use it.
Oh, there is no duck.
Quick, it's quick turn.
Okay.
Okay, now what?
Oh, okay.
Okay.
All right, so we're looking for a ladder.
I'm just gonna follow you, cuz story.
Unless you're...oh.
Over where?
Ow, I fell.
Do I get a flashlight?
Where's my flashlight?
I don't get a flashlight?
All right.
This is super fast-paced.
I don't know if I can keep up with this game.
I already did it.
What?
Can I pick that up?
What is that?
Oh, now what?
Oh, I have a flashlight.
All right, what are we, what are we looking, what's my objective, lady?
Wait, is this where I came from?
No.
Why don't you just, why don't you just keep that face mask on the entire time you're out here?
Why take that off, like, ever?
Get up there, how?
How do you want me to do this thing?
Is there another ladder?
Uh?
Yeah, it's a wall, but it's the...how else am I supposed to get up?
Back out, I guess, back out here?
I don't, I don't fucking know.
I don't know what I'm fucking doing.
I know hearing is probably my friend.
That's what I know.
Oh, okay.
So I missed this too early.
I hit the wrong button or something.
What?
What are you looking at?
How did they get me to play this?
Because it's Merry fucking Christmas.
That's how.
Merry fucking Christmas.
Uh-oh.
I know what, I know what chest-high cover means.
Waist-high, more like waist-high.
This meeting is gonna go well.
All right, where is the angle?
Fuck.
All right.
You got no ammo I can pick up.
That sucks.
Here we go.
Where am I supposed to frob to boost you up?
Oh, wait.
Here we go.
Uh-oh.
Another shootout.
Don't make it so fucking obvious.
I mean, really.
The instant, the instant I see this blasic, this blatant shootout playground, I'm instantly taken out of reality.
Story reality.
I am now in gameplay reality.
Story is an illusion.
How do I melee?
I don't wanna shoot, and make noise.
How do I melee?
You're not armed.
Eh, kinda neat.
I wanted to take him as a hostage.
It didn't work out that way.
It didn't work out that way.
If I, I guess if I just hol-, if I just hit Y and anything, nothing else, would, would I have used him as a human shield?
Cuz that would've been neat.
Come on in.
Come on in.
Come on in, pal.
Buddy o' mine.
Friend.
Guy.
Person.
Dude.
Fuck it.
Put that down.
I don't wanna use that.
Put it down.
Put it...
I kinda like the slower pace of the firefights and the, the stealthier aspects.
Kinda neat.
Kinda neat.
Fuck.
Could've done better.
My health is fine.
It's fine.
Is anybody worried about the gunfire they were hearing earlier?
Seeing if I can.
All right.
Now I can...nope.
No you don't.
Oh, shit.
Nope, no.
Nope.
Nope, nope, nope.
Oh, this is fucked.
Yep, that was fucked.
Oh.
Eh, the game's all right.
Way to get in my shot.
Nope.
Quick, to the ambush!
Do we?
Do we, really?
I was just gonna say, break his fucking arm already.
Murder!
Gun-running!
It's fun.
Am I enjoying the game?
It's okay.
Yeah, I don't enjoy controllers to play shooters, but it's not, it's not, like, a super fast-paced shooter.
It's manageable.
I won't be hitting the broadside of a barn, though.
Rich probably never finishes because it's so long.
I've never played this.
This is my first time I've ever touched this game.
Wait, I missed a shiny thing?
Oh, I'm on the rails now.
I can't go back.
That door, okay.
Where be guy?
Where guy at?
Where guy?
What, we have to go up here?
The door's, the door's over there.
There's no, there's no guys.
There's no guys.
Why, why go up?
Go up, why?
The bricks seem to alert everybody.
I don't know about this.
I don't know about this.
I'm gonna try.
You're not gonna...
Ugh, son of a bitch.
Now he's just looking my way.
Well, that's just great.
That's just fucking peachy keen.
Peachy fucking keen.
Are you gonna st...
You just gonna stay there?
You just gonna stay there?
You're not gonna turn...
You're not gonna, don't, don't investigate...
All right.
I'm never using bricks again.
They, they make for a terrible lure.
She sure took him out.
That's funny.
I did something the game wasn't programmed for.
Lady.
You're getting in my way.
All right.
So, apparently I really need to hit somebody with a brick.
We'll try it.
We'll try it.
Oh, there goes two.
Can I drop this without making a ton of noise?
Goddammit.
Can I stealth with brick?
Probably not.
Lousy.
Lousy.
Whenever you fail, fail at stealth, it just makes you feel bad.
It was fine combat stealth.
It's a nice blend.
All right, where, where are we off to, lady, lady, miss lady pants?
Miss lady pants, where am I going?
Where, where are you, miss lady pants?
Oh, you're down there.
Where's the stairway?
Stairs around here somewhere, right?
L3 if I'm lost.
Yeah, L3 does nothing.
I know where I'm going, I think, but L3 does not...it's not doing anything.
Nobody donated enough to make me play this.
This is Merry Christmas.
Try to do something nice for the fucking holidays.
What do I get for it?
I'm gonna use the force on you.
Ooohh.
Oooohhh.
What do you do?
Get out of my way, kid.
Get out of my...
Get out of my way.
Yeah, that's right.
You back off.
You back off.
What, you, you think you can just replace my dog?
I mean, my daughter.
Was that what you think?
Is that what you think?
You think you can just be a surrogate?
All right, where are we going?
This looks like the only way I can go.
Yep.
What would Don Wilson do?
I can't do it today.
It, it, I just can't.
It would take too much out of me.
It took too much out of me the other night.
I don't even know what I'm supposed to do with this, but I know it's here, so I have to do something with it.
Over there?
Umm...
Stairs, probably not stairs.
Where's the spot I have to climb up to?
It's probably there.
Will that reach?
I dunno.
Can you climb that?
Probably not.
Ooh, I did the quick turn.
I figured out the quick turn.
Aughh!
I don't know how you're gonna climb that, little girl.
I hope you can jump.
Are you gonna climb up on your own, or do I have to help you up?
I don't know.
I'm gonna just keep going.
Took your sweet-ass time.
Well, dogboy13, I'm glad to keep hope alive.
But you're gonna have to deal with me talking less, and experiencing the game more.
Just the trade-off.
Sorry.
Schmaltz!
Schmaltz!
How, how do I feel about this character?
Do I not like this character?
This character is okay.
Uh, this character is, "My daughter died, feel bad for me."
That's his character so far.
He's, he's "My daughter died, feel sad for me, and learn to love replacement daughter."
I, I now know the entire story of how he's gonna be kind of standoff-ish, but he's gonna grow attached to this little girl.
And this little girl's probably gonna learn how to be tougher and, and self-sufficient by hanging out with a grizzled dude.
I, I already know what's gonna happen on their road trip together alone.
Because, obviously, chick isn't going to come with them.
I'm not saying that's a bad story, but, it, you know, it's fairly predictable.
It's fairly standard.
Blatant, blatant drama.
It's fine.
It's not a dealbreaker.
It's just, it's just not a revelation.
It's just, well, yeah, duh.
That's what they're doing.
Oh, I have to climb up.
I thought you were gonna climb up.
How long do I plan to...
Probably not all night.
This isn't, this isn't gonna be a Christmas marathon.
I can take photos.
Why would I wanna take photos?
I'm not gonna look at them later.
It's not like this is my vacation.
Run where?
Clearly I'm not supposed to sprint because I have to keep ducking.
All right, so obviously I have to deal with these guys.
Or maybe not, they go away on their own.
Follow me.
All right.
Follow me.
Follow me to the place.
I am assuming the kid has magic-don't-get-detected-by-people powers.
Cuz, I think, an escort mission with stealth would be obnoxious.
And I think that, I'm gonna hope that they know that.
All right.
Oh, nope, nope.
I'm gonna guess you have some kind of armor, and I'm not supposed to shoot you.
All right, that's fine.
Nope.
Who shot?
Eh.
Where do I buy my video games?
At, at the store.
To be fair, most things I end up getting these days are from Steam.
You know what, I'm thinking the brick's a bad idea.
At no point has a lure ever worked out well for me.
Can I take your nice gun?
I can't take your good gun.
Oh, well, fuck off.
Fuck off, you.
You person, you.
Oh, great.
Eh.
Try that again.
Just die.
Why hate on this game?
It's, it's, it's just okay.
It's fine.
Nope.
Yes, let me use the flashlight, so the people with guns can see this light.
I know, I know it's probably not, it's probably programmed so they ignore it, but it just feels wrong.
See, doesn't that, doesn't that feel weird?
I'm gonna stealth with the flashlight on.
Nobody here.
Ignore the, ignore the light.
Oh, no.
Is there crafting?
There's crafting.
Oh, fuck.
How am I suppoed to craft?
Oh, what's wrong with crafting is it's probably going to be tedious.
Don't mind my flashlight.
Don't mind my immersion-breaking flashlight.
Yes, this is the RLM Twitch stream.
It's really just Rich Evans and Jack, and sometimes Jay.
Jay, did I say Jay?
Yes, Jay is here right now.
He's just not saying anything.
He's been silent this whole stream.
He's in, he's intensely watching the story.
He's not tied up and gagged because I've went insane and taken everyone hostage.
Is that building leaning over?
I don't...I don't think architecture works that way.
This game was made after 9/11, right?
We know, we know what happens when there's some kind of structural failure in a large building.
And they don't, they don't comically tip over.
Are they clipping?
I'm not an engineer, but I know architects probably designed these buildings so they don't fall over sideways, and destroy half a city.
I'm pretty sure they're designed to implode.
That just looks dumb.
How do I get around?
Is there a way around here?
Probably not.
All right.
Nope.
I actually can't fall off, which, all right.
Ah, ah, there it is, there's the hidden path.
I'm playing on normal, because it's normal.
That's what, and that's, normal should be the default difficulty.
And if people wanna bitch cuz normal's too easy, then it shouldn't be called normal, it should be called easy.
Is he gonna pop up?
All right, I'm grabbing crafting shit, but I have no idea how to craft yet.
What does R1 do?
R1, is there a craft button?
No?
What's the worst controller I have used?
The N64 controller.
What the fuck is it doing.
Why the fuck does it have the analog stick in the fucking middle.
There is no, there is, oh wait.
So I can make a shiv?
Is that all I can do?
I can just make a shiv?
Those are my, my option is make a shiv, and make a shiv.
Do I wanna make a shiv, or do I wanna make a shiv.
And maybe, I'll, I think I'll make a shiv.
With, with, I made a shiv with duct tape and, like, nuts and bolts.
That's okay.
That's okay.
I get it.
But, it happened.
Wait.
Wait, you have to hide?
They hear by, they, they spot you by sound.
You just have to stand still, right?
And why don't you have your gas masks on?
Because you're just probably knocking spores loose left and right there.
Left and right.
Oh, really, the building that's leaning over comically, in defiance of all known physics, you think it's getting ready to fall apart?
You think?
You think, you think maybe?
You think, you think maybe the leaning tower of building is getting ready to fall apart?
You think, you think it's gonna happen?
Is it gonna happen?
Is it gonna fall apart?
The building is leaning, comically?
I'm just taking all this shit, I don't know what it does, I just want it.
I want all the shit.
Gimme all the shit.
Is that shit I can, what is that?
Now, if this were The Order, I'd be able to pick that picture up, wave it around in my hands, and put it back down.
Fortunately, I can't do that here, because that would be stupid.
It's something Stewie does, but I dunno if that can only be attributed to Stewie.
I think, I think the voice getting higher thing, that's just, just, just a thing.
That has become synonymous with Stewie, but I think it was a thing before Stewie.
Stewie did not invent condescending.
Oh, what's my health like?
Do I need a patch up?
Eh, yeah.
Yeah, but I think, I think modern, I know the Leaning Tower of Pisa, of course I know about that, but, I'm pretty sure that modern buildings have been designed to collapse down.
Because they don't wanna kill thousands of people in the, in the occasion...you don't want, you don't want your city, like, falling like dominos.
What the fuck.
Why did my controller make noises?
Is there a way to quietly put this shit down?
Like, am I, am I just stuck with this in my hand now?
Do I have to make nosie to get rid of this?
Will any combination of buttons quietly put this away?
Oh, I'm late, late to the party here.
They are attracted to noise.
I threw the noise-making thing, and it does not come running.
What do I press to drop it?
Go where?
Go where?
Go where?
Oh, okay.
Gimme a second to what?
What are you gonna do?
That will, that will bring all of the noise-sensing monsters running to you.
Why doesn't that just open the drawers?
Because they're rusted shut.
I'll buy that.
That's fine.
Okay.
Do your thing.
What are you...head towards the thing.
This is all fairly on the rails.
I don't, I don't know.
Oh, my god.
Nice.
Okay.
Distractions are great.
They're, they're great.
I, I can't tell you how much, how much I love the distractions.
They're, they're great.
Great.
Have I said how great that is, when I did that thing, and it did nothing?
Oh, that one's a clicker, so it won't see me.
So I just have to be quiet with him.
Two there, one there.
Fucking son of a bitch.
All right, will you work for a change?
Yes, you will.
Eh, so much for stealth.
All right, good on health.
Where are we going, where are we going?
Oh, is it gonna slide back down?
Eh, that's clever.
It's not like it was a puzzle I had to solve.
It solved it for me.
Why have a puzzle?
Eh, fuck it.
I'm full.
All right.
How do you put away a weapon?
I guess you don't have to?
Why would I put a weapon away?
Because I don't accidentally wanna shoot somebody in the face?
I don't accidentally wanna make noise?
Nope, I don't think I've been here.
Wait, is that where we came from?
I think that's where we came from.
Has nobody, has nobody in the chat ever accidentally pulled the trigger, or what-not, in a game?
Is this completely heard of, unheard of, to you people?
Uh, I think the other way has gotta be the way I came from.
I don't remember where I came from.
Son of a bitch.
Do I buy any gaming, uh, pepherials?
Peripherals?
I guess, peripherals, yes.
I, just my fancy gaming mouse, really.
And it's not even really a gaming, it's not meant to be a gaming pepherial, pre-, prepherial, whatever.
Fucking whatever.
But I gotta just a number pad that I use in place of a regular keyboard, cuz it's smaller, and can move it around.
Don't have to have half a keyboard hanging off the desk to use the number pad, which I prefer to WASD, and you can bitch about that if you want.
I gotta collect the garbage.
Should there really be more zombies hanging around?
Oh, new item.
Which I suppose I'm gonna have to use.
Okay.
She, she keeps making me take point.
I don't think she wants to get involved.
This is slightly less linear and, and boring than The Order.
Can't strangle 'em, have to shiv them.
Got it.
Got it.
Makes sense.
That means I need more shivs.
I don't have more shivs.
Means I'm gonna have to beat them to death.
How do I switch to my thing?
How do I use my bat?
Is that in just the main weapons list here?
I want that bat.
How do I switch to the damn bat?
Does it just automatically switch to the bat when I do melee?
Don't waste shivs taking out these things quietly?
Why don't I wanna do that?
Do I not want to kil all the things here?
I gotta, I gotta, no, I gotta wooden stick on my back.
Is that not a weapon?
What?
How did you run right past that thing?
Nothing.
Nope.
All right, I'm not sure why that didn't work.
Everyone's all about the bricks.
The bricks suck.
Don't run in front of me like that.
It's frightening.
My only option was to shiv.
All I could do.
I could just shiv.
Is this game worth my...
Eh.
Whatever.
The, the story elements are, I get it.
I get it.
Yeah, I tried melee with the bricks.
It, it ate my face.
I'll try again.
I'll try melee with the brick again.
It's not working.
It sucks as a lure, and so far it sucks as a weapon.
Oh, fuck.
You need a shiv to kill a clicker.
How come you can run?
Why are you magic?
It's not the button I wanted.
Which way are you facing.
Why can't I get behind you?
Combination move, that's something I want.
Yeah, ;you think, you think the horrible monsters are scary?
Yeah, it's probably a fair statement.
I can get behind that.
Combination's in the safe.
Where's my safe?
Oh, these lures suck.
The lures just fucking suck.
So much for luring several of them together with these amazing lures with an effective range of three inches.
They'll lure everything within three inches of where ya throw the lure.
I'm struggling on normal because I'm taking too much time.
Here.
That's how the game wants to be played.
Throw them close to the bad guys.
So I can get the bad guy to, to slightly move, as opposed to move a lot?
All right, I'm officially swearing off lures.
I'll grab a brick.
I might punch somebody in the face with it, apparently it's all it's fucking good for.
All right, now what?
Is there a crowbar?
I was in there.
Assuming there's some sort of crowbar.
But I've been wrong before.
Maybe I just shoot the lock.
What?
What does that do?
What did that do?
I'm feeling this game is...ehhh, it's a game.
Yeah.
It's not super fun stealth.
It's stealth.
Ehh...survival, something something, survival.
Nope.
All right, now what?
All right, what do you say?
You don't say anything useful to me.
Never played Splinter Cell.
I have a brick.
Look up.
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Climb the ladder.
Rich can't look up.
Why would I even think to look up?
Eh, I've died a couple times.
It's not a no-death run.
It's the first time I've even played the game.
So I wouldn't attempt something on the first attempt.
The first, first time through a game would be madness.
Absolute madness.
Probably to the obvious hole in this building.
How do we get through?
Oh, here's a door.
Use a super effective lure.
My god, it worked.
The lure worked.
There's people shooting at me, too?
Or is that what's-her-face hitting me?
All right, big thing I can move, obviously I've gotta, okay...
Why are you people so pissed off that I found, if I find crafting annoying, as a general rule?
Why is that, what makes that curmodgeon-y?
Oh, I have fifteen...is there more to be found around here?
If I can make something more useful...I don't know.
No additional scrap.
Okay.
Sure, why not, why not.
Minecraft is highly unlikely.
Just another door.
Do I own a handheld console?
I got a DS, that's about it.
All right, chat, why, what makes this game the best thing ever?
What is it?
Tell me.
Tell me.
If you're gonna be upset at me for not loving it, why am I wrong for not loving it?
And I didn't even say hate.
At no point did I use the word hate.
It's, ehh, it's fine.
The game portions aren't super, super fun.
All right.
When it wants me to dip the controller like that, why?
What is going on?
What the fuck is that?
Why does it have me do that every now and then?
What is that?
Oh, charge your flash, oh...
Oh, you're a clicker.
I got one shiv.
I probably don't need to kill you, so why waste the time.
The question is, where do I have to go?
Yeah, I can kill them with a brick.
But that's probably gonna make noise, and it's probably gonna make the rest, coming.
If there's a way through, I'm pretty, probably better off just finding the way through.
Unless I just have to kill all of the things, it's just something I have to do.
Is that something I just have to do?
You do not have to kill all the...I wasn't trying!
Every other section I've been through so far, I've had to kill all the things.
Theoretically, I guess I could've gotten through that last section, but I'm assuming yanking that ladder down would have brought them all running.
All right, bored, so up it is.
Yeah, I fucking love Bloodborne.
Bloodborne's fucking great.
Is there another brick?
Where's the next brick?
Hey, you guys got it.
Looking for a brick.
Can I hit somebody with a bottle?
Will that do anything?
Yeah, oh, yeah, it was pretty...
Too damn close?
That was not too close enough.
Is he playing The Last of Us, meh?
That's kinda how I feel so far.
Meh.
Eh.
Eh.
Eh.
All right, where are we gonna need to climb?
That way, that's where we need to climb.
Gotta move the climbing machine.
Get outta my way, bitch.
Can't move my thing when you're in the way.
There we go.
Gets better.
The tutorial is bad.
It gets better.
The first few hours are bad.
All right.
It gets better.
The first ten hours are kinda blah, but then it gets a lot better after the first ten hours.
It's all right-ish.
I, I, I dunno.
I'm not, can I not, I can only try, sprinting is, sprinting is not okay right now, cuz they have to talk.
Oh, she's gonna get eaten.
No?
No.
Not here.
Like, right after that "Follow me", that was, like, the perfect time for her to get bitten.
Cuz she has to be, she has to be removed so we can focus on girl and guy.
So we can focus on daughter, dead daughter man, and surrogate daughter.
He's totally gonna put a bullet in her brain.
Not the little girl, but the older girl.
The woman.
I think he's gonna murder Tess after she gets bitten.
She's gonna get bitten.
You have to do it.
Put me out my misery, I don't wanna be one of them!
It's gonna happen.
It's gonna be a close up of her face.
I'm gonna have the gun up, and she says pull the trigger.
Just do it.
Just do it.
Oh.
Did it already happen?
Oh, it happened already.
Off screen.
I'm actually shocked we're not gonna have to pull the trigger.
Somebody said once that every plot has been done.
It's just a matter of how you do it.
I guess, it's, storywise, I don't, whatever, I don't care...
I care about playing a game.
The game portions are...blah?
If this were a zombie movie, and not a game, would, would you love it, or would you think this was fairly generic?
Would this be a great zombie movie, honestly, if they turned this into a film?
Would there just be, a zombie movie?
We all know about lures.
What?
Oh...
Oh, please.
Ehh, fuck off.
Really?
All right, where'd that one asshole come from?
Oh.
Sure.
Drag the body where they won't see it?
No.
No, I cannot.
I wish I had a good sense for how good their vision was, like...
Will he, I dunno, I'm not sure if that guy will see me if I try to go in that door.
Fuck.
Well, he wasn't wearing armor, didn't seem to matter.
Oh, bullshit!
Fucking bullshit.
Yeah, I don't know why Jack tweeted no stream.
I told him I was gonna try and do a solo stream.
Maybe he forgot.
Maybe he didn't know I was gonna try tonight.
Coming this way?
Duck.
Oh, shit.
Shit.
Presume the resolver, revolver, has more stopping power.
I think that's what I want.
Oh, my god, I left for five minute...yeah, you have to craft.
I, I need the shit.
Rich said he doesn't like crafting, but he's crafting in a game, he's a hypocrite.
That's something I have to do.
I hate everyone.
I, I want you to know that, chat.
I hate, I hate every, every single one of you.
All of you.
Oh...button prompts that don't work.
No, I'm not gonna do a video about this game.
Why, why...I can tell what's going on, why do I need the flashlight?
So I can feel odd when I have my flashlight on when I'm stealthing, and people don't notice the man with the flashlight?
Is that what you want me...
All right.
All, all flashlight, all the fucking time.
That's what we're doing.
This is the flashlight stream.
I gotta find you a fucking boat?
Eh.
Learn to fucking swim.
That's what we'll figure out.
Why aren't you going...twice.
All right, you don't want to go there.
All right.
All right.
Fucking raft, like, over here?
No.
Is there another way around, or something?
So, it's not like a puzzle, we just have to take this path?
What is, what's going on?Oh.
This is not the solution.
How about diving, that's a good trick.
Swim, swim in the direction, swim in the direction of things.
Grab the things.
There's no sound effect for grabbing things.
Why not?
Hurry up, need air.
Is there a way to swim...there we go.
Why is it so quiet?
Because I'm plyaing a game.
God, you swim so slow.
Is there a swim faster button?
There's an up and down button, but there's not...oh, god, just drown.
All right, I can't go there.
All right.
Oh, there's, there's our raft.
Took us long enough.
Where ya at, ya brat?
Get on the fucking thing.
Get on the thing.
Climb.
Climb thing.
All right, how come I can't climb thing?
I, can I climb on board?
How do I get up?
Oh.
All right.
All right.
Do your thing.
All right, there it goes.
We gotta wave my flashlight, for some reason.
Batteries okay.
Just gotta wave it around.
What's a good name for Dark Souls II?
Dark Souls II is a good name for Dark Souls II.
Have I figured out that doing task is part of the game?
Is doing task enjoyable?
That's the question.
I know it's part of game, but is, is task in game enjoyable, is the real question.
Does anything in life bring me joy?
Yeah, it's not like I love Bloodborne, or, or Helldivers, or a ton of other games.
I don't like this game, so obviously I'm a humorless schmuck.
I don't even hate this game, it's just kinda...tedious.
Tedious and not exciting.
Fairly, fairly blandlish, slowish pace gunplay.
I can play something else.
Look, you wanted this.
You're getting it.
Merry Christmas.
She was just being a normal little girl, briefly.
That's fine.
That's a fine moment.
I'm just being an asshole there.
I think I was supposed to click on that gate first, so I, so I, so I don't miss the phone again.
You'd know what I'm talking about if you're being in the stream.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna click on this gate.
I'm gonna find out I can't get it in, I'm assuming, and I have to use that plank to do a thing?
Where was that at?
The button prompt went away?
It was a thing.
I thought I had to click on it over here.
I guess that went away because I skipped over learning I can't get through this way?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Yep, board over there to get in.
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
It's already done.
It's already done.
Yeah, I already figured it out, kid.
Do I gotta bring it up with me, maybe?
Can I do that?
Oh, maybe I can grab it from the top.
Oop.
Wrong button.
When did I start streaming?
Roughly three hours and twenty minutes ago.
Wait, how do I upgrade this?
Where is the...
Where is the thing?
How to do thing.
Apparently, I can't do that.
I can't improve the melee weapon.
Why did it tell me about that?
I don't know.
I don't know.
All right.
Let's get to the place.
It's gonna be full of the things.
The, thingss full of...
There's gotta be things around here somewhere.
There's things everywhere.
Everything is just things.
Thing thing thing thing thing.
Heard a thing.
There's a thing.
Oh shit, what?
Oh, you're in the thing.
And I can't upgrade this?
I can't upgrade that.
Eh, that's annoying.
That fucking f-...
We've seen dozens of them!
This is nothing new, kid.
I don't wanna waste my stick.
That stick's only got, like, a few swings in it.
If I can kill instantly with it, that'd be one thing, but I can't.
Yeah, she's trying to whistle with zombies outside.
To be fair, I think maybe the game expects me to have killed the zombie.
Which I did not do.
Wow, these clickers, they have amazing hearing.
That's how they find you, with the hearing.
Eh, so much for that weapon.
Look, if normal difficulty is easy, it should be called easy.
Oh.
All right, I guess there wasn't anything super cool by those clickers.
All right.
That was a waste of everything.
That was a waste of my life.
I just go down there somewhere?
Yeah, sure.
We'll go down there somewhere.
It's not gonna be an all-night stream.
I have never claimed that.
You could, you could technically donate for an all-night stream, but I wouldn't see it, because I'm streaming from the PS4, and I'm not hearing donations.
Which, if you donated, thank you very much.
Sorry I haven't been able to read your name.
And if you've subscribed, I'm sorry I haven't been able to read your name.
Rich, do you believe in ancient aliens?
No, I do not.
I believe Egyptians built the pyramid.
Why don't you start playing music?
What?
Is this the hipster music store?
Vinyl.
I guess it's the only kind of music store that can exist these days.
Cuz I don't think this was supposed to be the zombie apocalypse of 1975.
What a weird menu to go through.
5-17-21.
Guess it's gonna be a different safe.
I probably didn't read a note from one of those safes from before.
That, that one safe from before.
All right.
I missed the bow and arrow?
There's a bow and arrow I can pick up?
That sounds fun.
It's over here?
So Bob built this all on his own?
With zombies everywhere?
How did he do that?
How'd he do that?
I wanna know.
How'd he do thing.
All right.
Nope.
Nope, this is not the way we're looking for.
All right.
All right.
I guess we have to go this way.
What happened to duck, kid?
It's a good thing you're magic.
Rich, do you think aliens kickstarted evolution?
Why would I think that?
Ladder on the floor by the...oh, fucking ladders.
It's an RV, not a van.
I'm assuming that's not what you're talking about.
I don't remember a van.
Is there a van back there?I don't know.
All right, no van.
Nope, nope, don't see a ladder.
Don't see a ladder.
You mean by this thing?
Truck could be...called a big van?
Oh.
Yeah.
All right.
Thank you.
Explain my cosmological beliefs to you.
Uh, there is a universe.
We're in it.
That's not what I wanted you to do, Nathan Drake.
Not-Nathan Drake.
Gruff, gruff Nathan Drake.
Daddy man.
Daddy man McLand.
Kind of an idiot, then.
So she's gonna save him with the bow later.
All right, where's the plank.
There's always a plank.
All right.
There's a plank.
Let's go find the plank.
Oh, wait.
I gotta grab this plank, probably.
That makes sense.
Climb the thing.
For fuck's sake.
All right, now climb the thing.
Now grab the plank.
This is, this is, this is some intense plank action we have going on right here.
Intense.
Looks, looks like old moldy piece of crap, though.
That's not gonna support this man's weight.
All right.
Get off the thing, so I can...
I was gonna tra-, strand you over there.
Dammit.
You're too quick for me.
Get away.
Get away.
I'm sure I have to use this plank again.No?
I can't even pick it up.
The game, the game knows I'm supposed to be done with it.Is that what's going on?
I don't know.
Can you use...probably not.
And stay.
Oh, joy.
Oh, joy.
Can you stop wobbling?
Ah, realism.
Love the realism.
Eh, fuck it.
Oh, no, and it's, it's one use.
Shit.
Of course it's one use.
Bow and arrow sucks.
He's wobbly, and the head is wobbly.
And it, I have to use a controller to do this.
I hate this.
There.
I don't, I don't into shooting in general with a controller.
I'm far, far more comfortable with a mouse.
And a controller, if you're gonna make it all wobbly...oh, fuck you.
You're immune to everything.
You wanna run through there, little girl?
I'm still not sure...why is this game so much gooder than other game?
I'm not, I'm not sure why you think that?
Can I disarm that trap?
I'm gonna try.
What's so great about the story?It's...
There's...
All right.
I tried to get close enough to it, cuz you told me I could disarm that trap.
I tried to get close enough to dis-, wait for it, uh, uh, um, dismantle icon to pop up or something.
And it didn't happen.
I'm blaming that one on the chat for saying I could disarm that.
And that was just dumb.
That was just dumb.
Cuz I was looking at the chat while walking forward.Here.
Don't wanna waste that health.
What?
Oh, I thought you were a zombie.
Get...
Oh, flashlight.
Right, right.
You gotta have this flashlight on at all times.
I don't know if this is worth it.
Get the hell outta here when I damn well say we'll get the hell outta here.
All right.
How do I do this quickthrow here?
How does this work?
What?
Ugh...
No, Mass Effect 1 and 2 are depressing in hindsight.
Three is so bad it actually ruins 1 and 2.
Oh, wrong button.
All right, let's get whatever was in here.
And you think the fridge isn't boobytrapped?
Oh, what's the gameplay purpose of this?
Yeah.
There we go.
No, reload!
Fuck.
Well, I can't manually reload.
Square button?
Every other time I had to reload, it was R2 when not aiming.
Ow.
Oh, god.
Now I have to aim with the controller, but he does that waving shit.
Can't even hold the fucking gun steady.I hate this.
Eh, there we go.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Wow, what an amazing game!
What...amazing!
You can't reload manually.
Everytime I try, it just shoots.
Oh.
Wait, why would you, why were you not doing that right before?
Ugh, I hate this.
I don't like gaming with a fucking controller.
How many times do I have to say that?
Rich doesn't like things he's bad at.
Jesus Christ.
Fuck this.
Oh, for fuck's sake.
What happened to the one-hit kill thing that I upgraded on this thing?
All right.
I guess I, I, ugh...
Whoops.
Nope.
Wrong, didn't see it soon enough.
I wish I didn't waste my, my scrap on that upgrade.
Completely fucking worthless upgrade.
Eh, that's great.
Climb up the, get out of my fucking way.
Ugh...
So, grab everything.
And don't upgrade that one-hit kill because the one-hit kill just blatantly doesn't work.
I was totally right about this, though.
Story first, game second.
It's not as bad a game as The Order is, and the story sections aren't as obnoxiously on the rails, though it's still the same basic beast.
As compared to The Order.
Better characters, yes.
Close the door, you're letting all the zombies in.
I'm not torturing you, chat.
I thought everyone loved this game.
Yeah, stream probably would be better with Jack.
We all know to get with a Rich Evans solo stream.
A lotta crap.
Yes, I, I'm not loving this game, so therefore I only love indie pixel shooters.
Ugh...Merry Christmas.
Come in and do a stream, and I get shit on.
This was a mistake.
Are we done walking yet?
What, did I move slightly too loud?
Ugh...
Oh, it's a dead end.
Maybe you shouldn't talk around the, the, the nearly death, ultra-hearing zombies.
Use my shiv on 'em.
I've got one shiv.
Really, probably save it for when I need it.
Are you stuck in there?
Oh, are you, you're in my way.
All right.
Are these the normal zombies?
All right, why do you choke sometimes, and the action takedown other times?
All right, so where are we going?
Where is, what is our objective here?
This must be more exciting to play than to watch?
No, not really.
I'd rather play this than The Order.
Batman games attempt an entirely different form of stealth.
I'd say it's more fun than this.
But, you know, whatever.
So I'm assuming, for extra drama, Bill's gonna die.
After the car.
Oh, no, he's definitely gonna find out she's bit.
And then he's gonna try and murder the girl, so we're gonna have to murder Bill.
To save the girl.
That's a thing that's going to happen.
Nope.
Eh, fuck it.
Is this a scripted swarm?
Is there no way around this shit?
Yeah, this is scripted.
Why is there a ladder on top of the bus?
I wasn't sure if this where I was supposed to use the shotgun or if I was supposed to run.
What was the intention.
Fuck's sake.
It's a better story than The Order.
The Order is, is far more of an on-the-rails, click things...button prompt fest.
That mean I'm infected now?
All right, I guess stealth was not an option with that guy.
Crap.
I just wanted to see if you could melee it.
Apparently not.
Nope.
I wanna, let me switch my gun.
Can I do that?
Can I do that before the fight breaks out, or am I just stuck with that gun?
I'm just stuck with that gun.
Nope.
Oh, video game shotguns, two-foot range, oh joy.
You can tell how shitty a shooter is by how awful the shotgun is.
No, I didn't know I was supposed to save the bomb until this fight.
Cuz I didn't know this fight was coming.
I used the bomb when I, I, the game didn't want me to use the bomb.
That's what happened.
I can't tell if this is doing much damage to this thing.
I guess stealth and avoidance wasn't an option there.
As far as Space Cop goes, we're probably all fucked till the first of this year at this point.
Obviously, we wouldn't be able to get them out in time for Christmas.
Melee weapon doesn't even last for, like, one fucking zombie.
All right, you fuckers.
Oh, god.
A ladder.
Can I craft that?
Am I out of...
Oh, well.
Oh, well, Bill.
Wait.
How do you know how to pop a clutch?
Where are the zombies?
Nope.
Back loading my gun.
Poor Bill.
How come they're not getting swarmed?
Good call.
It's been twenty years.
Do they really have enough people coming through in, via cars to, to make an ambush, like, uh, a thing you'd have ready to go?
Oh, no.
Oh, no!
Oh, oh, we died!
Oh, there goes my, there goes my 75-death run.
75 deaths.
That was what I put the number at, and we hit it.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
All right.
Well, I did it.
I did it.
I played The Last of Us, and, and now you have at least an idea of what I think about The Last of Us, as I discovered it.
That's The Last of Us.
Have, have a nice night.
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, everybody!
