[Part I]
so it's quite possible that we're
streaming but also possible that we're
not at all these are the two options
that we are streaming or not streaming
Schrodinger stream you're doing what
Schrodinger stream yes we our stream
exists in a realm where it's neither
streaming nor not streaming we won't
know till it's observed exactly yes I
think it's working
I see nothing going on in the streamer
my is offline for me you might have to
refresh mine is going my mine is going
so you might want to refresh yours cuz I
think we're streaming fiction it no this
is not pictionary guys this is my new
just wait yell animation that I made
this afternoon which I'm very excited
about wait to see this rich it's very
exciting it's loading video oh great
here's what sorry I my I guess we're
echo going on because I can hear these
stream audio and I'm turning that off
now oh good okay okay good good turn
that off now it's not time for that so
he actually did pictionary just wait
y'all screens I did I did a a an MS pain
- just wait y'all screen and yeah you're
seeing what it is now I just wanted to
show off a little bit of my mad drawing
skills rich and I'm very excited about
it and that's all
it's just a stupid little loop and I
love it uh so anyway hi everybody
welcome to the sunday night hack and a
half stream extravaganza so are you
starting with a super time force I want
to start with super time force yes okay
okay the cool you know and it's I don't
have to a super time force was was a
game that I would like to revisit
because last time I played it I I was a
little I was drinking and I was a little
ornery and it wasn't a game of my flavor
and everyone kept on saying I needed to
give it another chance of real chance
and so because today is daylight saving
time I thought it would be a fun pun to
do super time force daylight savings
super time force also we don't have to
we could just play Monaco and I could
end with super time force whatever you
wonder do you want to do it's fine the
question for you rich is do you feel how
late do you feel like going cuz you know
we could just we could start with Monaco
than if you want to drop off later I
know you've been working all day you
know what you you you didn't like super
time for us last time but you're playing
it pretty late maybe you should start
with it this time okay just to give it
the best possible chance to work for you
sure sure
daylight saving was a week ago no
daylight saving was yesterday
daylight saving was yesterday or this
morning it was at 2:00 o'clock this
morning today is the start or the today
is the end of daylight saving at least
it was here you know I mean it might be
different elsewhere I don't know I don't
know things worse other places in the
world even do that ridiculous daylight
savings business I think it's only
America and like a few American colonies
okay so not in Europe silly Americans I
know I'm sorry look there's people those
people here who think it's a dumb idea
there are petitions
and daylight savings and I'm all for it
I agree I I don't understand the point
of daylight saving it's not there's no
there's no ass daylight saving it's not
in you to say savings because I don't
give a fuck
the touchet my friend
the other thing hopefully everyone in
the chat is noticing is rich and I had a
out of professionalism and actually
tested out our Skype call and our audio
before we started streaming so hopefully
everyone is hearing us at approximately
equal volumes and so tell us if you are
or if we've I've messed up somehow this
is just a thing it was for farmers to
have an extra hour of work yeah yeah no
I understand the point before we had
electricity but now we have electricity
farming is done with computers and and
in computerized tractors right great hey
sound is good rich our sound is good oh
my god that's unbelievable we're
starting to turn this into a real thing
we learn as we go um I've already played
Harvest Moon shed or at least one guy in
the chat yeah I I like the earlier
Harvest Moon games the later ones to
start getting silly so yeah Harvest Moon
are you flayed Harvest Moon I remarried
a little bit I got bored okay I got very
bored with Harvest Moon III I love back
to nature mmm that was great I'm not a
great all right that's great
I'm glad you enjoyed it I have a Harvest
Moon piracy story a Harvest Moon piracy
story I'm so excited to hear this let's
go I never would have bought a farming
simulator like ever in my life then one
day I was looking at a list of Super
Nintendo roms and I see this
crazy-looking farming game and I like
III downloaded the ROM and I played it
illegally ah illegally yes and then
sight unseen I think I paid you know
full price on release day the next five
versions of Harvest Moon that got
released because you got a chance to try
it out yes yes but let's see the key
here is though I actually did give them
money sure yeah
well really it's not a piracy story so
much as a like a demo story yes the game
should have demos demos are nice I'm not
drawing the same picture and over and
over again I did this earlier and then I
sped it up and looped it this actually
like it says two minutes it took me
about 12 minutes to draw the whole thing
but but it's on a two minute loop
because I sped it up in post I'm really
I really like my my crocodile brain and
lion brain drawing music we've we've
beat that joke into the ground oh yeah
oh you know what we've beat the joke
into the runt ground to where it's just
a reference now obviously we can't just
say that anymore but yeah yeah I'm going
to continue to make it a part of my
daily life the crocodile brain and lion
friend it is now it is now in my
repertoire okay so let's click off of
that let's get some super time force
happening um while I get super time
force happening rich do you want to you
want to tell people what was going on
today or what so a do you have any
stories to tell really don't we'll see
we'll see eventually
huh my my work today though involved you
know watching watching half naked lady
danced around for four hours so you know
it was a terrible horrible day at work
it sounds terrible it really is okay
hold on this might get loud for a second
I mean she was I mean she was so
attractive that sucks man that just
sucks hope not credits settings okay
you can't see super time for sultry yet
I'm working on it
this is a thing that I am officially
working on ultra okay and I go back here
and now you should be able to get great
man great so I don't know what do I do
here how to play you start with 60
seconds on the clock you need hey I am

in a second just making sure that's not
an error yes yeah cuz that's right you
you feel me now you hear me now what you
see video later you should see it now I
see it though okay okay sings know that
you need to make it to the end you can
time out okay great great
this is the first Halloween in four
years I didn't watch trick R treat me
and Jack actually just saw it for the
first time this Halloween we did that we
did there is an official Halloween party
I liked it yeah
it was into the individual stories of
trick-or-treat are really needs oh no I
don't remember how to play your reasons
for not liking that are just bizarre to
me there's an apology yeah I was
expecting some sort of wrapper I know
I'd liked it I liked it I liked it how
do we um how do I start over I forgot
how to play the game I hold on
sure for 21 Groundhog Day it's it's it's
well-made like classic horror type
stories it's almost like it's almost
like Tales from the Crypt with a budget
absolutely hey microfiber militia thanks
for subscribing we super appreciate it
yeah trick-or-treat is some super fun
stories
oh I've
I failed already rich I don't know oh no
I've seen videos of this game just the
style of the graphics it looks like a
bit confusing to play I also have no
idea what I'm doing I don't even know
how to shoot my gun is that bad I mean
that's bad that I can't figure out how
to shoot my gun did did you skip things
that explain this well that's the
question I've already played the the big
long tutorial section and I can't figure
out how to get back to the tutorial
levels okay okay and that's what I'd
like to do I'd like to get back to the
tutorial levels there there are you sure
there's not an option in the main menu
to replay the tutorial did you look I'll
check a lot okay let's let's return to
titles here read the instructions
absolutely yeah where's the tutorial
levels oh my god dick the bday boy dick
the bday boy thanks for subscribing
did you unsubscribe for a little bit or
is this a new dick the bday boy maybe
maybe maybe it expired what the month or
so oh sure sure that could be helping
options in any case thank you thank you
hey boy writing again oh here we go
clear save hi I just cleared my save so
now I can play the game
alright I'm gonna I'm gonna give this a
real shot this time rich because I
wasn't last time super time force
there's a cat it's pretty awesome
there's a cat you say there's a cat
alright alright
okay I've finally done it I've invented
time travel hooray for me I should say
it in his voice I've finally done it
I've invented time travel hooray for me
that's what he look like to me yeah it's
like an old man with a beard shed real
ah yeah what the fuck just happened
earthquakes fire robot army oh and I see
in a chat someone is asking about Team
Fortress 2 Halloween spooktacular
I didn't even play it I did not even
play scream fortress this year because
it was too confusing I just saw what the
update was and I said fuck it what did
they do
Team Fortress every Halloween has a
scream fortress event whether it's a
special Halloween event where they add
new maps and like new game and this year
it was a go-kart game okay I'm not
making it up a first-person shooter that
turns into a go-kart game and I said I
don't I don't want that okay okay it's
like I got two eye patches yes future
future old man doctor has two high
patches oh my god I really did it I
truly cracked the conundrums all right
can I skip no I can't skip the story I
can't skip anything I want this is a lot
of story guys
okay so we invented time travel and then
robots started attacking the city but
wait what if we caused all of this
yeah Jack what games do you refuse to
play refuse to play that's that's the
way they worded that Oh which is why I
read it because it's that's a good
question I against do I refuse to play
well now I've refused to play any Sonic
game
that's what else I just I know cuz I
know I probably won't like it
okay any any classic Sonic game you know
like Sonic Adventure maybe sonic racing
is a different thing will this count if
you played a little bit of it and never
want to touch it again well I what do
you have in mind five nights at Freddy's
I think the question is what game do you
refuse to play without playing it first
yeah I'm not trying to start a thing but
when it comes up
Mass Effect 4 you're gonna refuse I'm
gonna refuse to play that because I
don't want to get involved that universe
again sure up just a refresher for
anybody who doesn't know once that game
comes out if you want to send me a brand
new copy of Mass Effect 4 I will destroy
it on camera and we will find an awesome
way to destroy it do do you want over oh
hold on Grand Moff Kali thank you for
subscribing we super appreciate it rich
do you want to destroy it live or do you
want to like film a destruction oh I
don't know
I am thought of that I you know what
it'll be ascenders choice if someone
sends you a physical copy of Mass Effect
4 it can be their choice whether they
whether they want it to be filmed
which you know like the the joy of that
is it could be an awesome er destruction
right yeah yeah or if they want it live
which might be more visceral and
exciting yes
but obviously if if it's pre-filmed we
could do something amazing and actually
tiny ends so we should probably get
comfortable with our awesome skills okay
great I have to skip this I have to skip
all these cuts okay here we go I'm
getting comfortable with my awesome
skills now rich welcome to the face with
so okay so game I refuse to play you
know what game I refuse to play because
I know I'm not gonna like him
The Last of Us okay the the zombie game
were or the fungus monsters it's
probably a fine game it's probably too
cinematic for its own good
yep that's that's what I've heard and
I'm gonna believe the people both the
people who praised it for its cinematic
qualities and the people who've been
little and for its cinematic quality I'm
gonna believe both of them and I just
know it's not gonna be a game for me so
I've refused to play it I'm gonna guess
it's too heavily scripted to be fun as a
game I that's as far as for my tastes
you know I'm sure other people like that
but for my tastes
sure okay great a jumps rich a jumps X
Oh X shoots by the way but going back to
five nights at Freddy's we can't we
can't do anything right cuz somebody
somebody messaged me on Steam and was
giving me shit for not doing five nights
at Freddy's right how how can you not
play that correctly I I don't know I we
skipped a tutorial or something I didn't
I don't remember seeing an option for
tutorial and it's not like we didn't
understand the game by the time I gave
up right right it's such an easy game
you look at the things into power
management but it's dumb but you know
almost like somebody sent me a message
and said they were disappointed in me
and I couldn't irritated me you know I
really did as it should you guys it
should even you wouldn't like a game
I don't like but then to send me a
message specifically to tell me that
you're disappointed in me doesn't that
just make you want to have more steam
friends rich these people telling you
this mess messaging you telling you you
did things wrong
which strikes me as being too immune to
emotion to play horror games no I'm too
immune to crappy jump-scare says that
whore names whore in general really
needs to be done right I like I said I
mean thief the classic view mmm that was
a scary game the people's an unsettling
unsettling kind of eerie experience five
nights at Freddy's was just a mirror
that would jump out that's exactly what
it was goody goody goody goody goo
that's exactly what it was oh I can
create a little shield let's need
someone someone was messaging me on
Steam and okay I got it and asking me
you know like after the alien review
they were saying is there is there
something in a game that really scared
you that was a question and so I know
for you we got cut out of the episode
but you were talking about the the
hammer brothers and people the hammer
brothers no the hammer haunts the hammer
haunts it's a specific type of undead
creature in thief and oh god they're
they're terrified I mean graphics wise
that games the the video game equivalent
of stick figures down at the time hammer
haunts first time I saw one made me shit
myself okay sure sure that's that's not
literal that's an exaggeration what I
was thinking like for me it was left for
dead has has an enemy called the witch
and it's this like you know skinny
creepy looking zombie that cries in a
corner and you have the ability to sneak
around the witch but if you make too
much noise she comes in a taxi and she's
a fierce enemy right every single time I
went up against a witch I was scared out
of my
because it's a really tough enemy to
beat the atmosphere was right like the
music swelled when she's around there
was this like coral like Oh kind of
thing and you could just hear this
sobbing somewhere so you know she's
close you know scared the crap out of me
there's a there's a there's a moment in
thief one's this level called
return to the Haunted Cathedral okay and
you got to you got to get this artifact
that's kind of like hovering over this
this kind of raised altar and I I jumped
over and I grab the artifact that I I
fell off the platform and I land another
ground and in the middle of the
Cathedral all these hammer haunts are
there they start chasing me and I
actually in the game ran out of that
room just in a complete blind fucking
panic like my emotional state in real
life was just fuckin panic and I ran and
I just found a staircase and i i i
cowered under that staircase that's
great the time out and a team up you
save teammates become a powerup its add
to that charge okay I did a time out and
a team up extra hit I don't know if I
understand this yet
I don't know if I understand this yet
rich I like looking at the chat and
talking to you so I'm not even okay much
such into the game into thin air press
speed to timeout and add as many hours
as you need to blast down this wall okay
Oh
okay I think I'm doing it
I did it yay
right
I'm so happy for you that you should be
you should be I'm he's giving oh yes
thank you I KJ yes I'm for for those who
came late to the stream I'm giving this
another try because my first playthrough
I didn't much care for it and everyone
told me that it's a game then I would
really like and I should give it another
try and so I'm listening I'm listening
to you guys which I know is a terrible
idea but but I'm doing it anyway because
it's daylight saving time yet any time
he wants a timeout and tagging a new
team member
more fire Park now you could have played
the French version of sands of time
oh wow that would have been good too oh
that was dumb see you you fled sands of
time um yes have on you did you play the
other ones out of curiosity no no I did
not the the second one the the warrior
William God they like completely sold
out and one for lowest common
denominator yeah the the the Prince just
turned into a badass quote badass sure
sure
you know he was kind of like you know an
arrogant but but regal kind of character
you know he was he was a aristocrat crap
and in the second game he was like one
of the first things he says just shut up
bitch Flo's beating on somebody yeah
they got thick jelly they got a fair on
oh man well that's I mean that's that's
what they do right that's how they
handle sequels
completely redeem themselves with those
third one open but
I mean shut up Josh wait oh okay I get
it
all right I'm chef saying he was in a
restaurant I don't know if that's the
right word you mean he knows of noble
noble blood he wasn't he wasn't a
scumbag
sure yeah he wasn't a scumbag oh my god
what what can't a man rich what I don't
know I don't know what I'm doing that's
okay you're giving it another shot
I am
oh do I need to what
do I need to kill these that I don't get
this
or maybe I do I don't know okay
for like a game for a game that looks so
simple and is just about like people
shooting things it's very complicated I
just don't know if my tiny brain can
handle this okay folks I'm loading up a
live-fire combat simulation this is the
real deal you've got 60 seconds to make
it across the battlefield then you've
got 30 timeouts and you run out of those
while it's game over but this is no damn
game rich what do you think of Mormons
yeah how can anybody believe that shit
that's what I think of Mormons because
you know warminster they're relatively
recently you know in the grand scheme of
religions and now you can take a look
where do we see that it's like a fraud
and a gun a convicted con man who said
that he found what was it
gold-plated Scriptures points yeah yeah
Jewish Indian and he can translate with
the help of magic scrolls and then he
can't show you that the golden Scrolls
anymore because because they were taken
back by the angels or something like
that yeah now it's clear obvious
bullshit I don't I don't know what your
problem is rich
you know it's one of those things where
I'm sure individual people can be nice I
have a relative that converted to
Mormonism
oh do you I love them but I don't know
what the fuck they're thinking ha ha ha
sure sure um I think that's fair oh okay
I'm dying I'm dying
okay I did again I'm dead again what do
I do here why do here it's okay I do
this sign that's to answer the chat
family get-togethers aren't fun for
anybody my family drinks a lot so
they're pretty fun Chad says Jesus stop
jumping into them well I'm figuring it
out chat settle down is that what I
guess I'm saying I'm missing the glory
to whatever the Glore bar
Jesus stop jumping into them yeah
somebody keeps asking what our pain is
on virtual reality gaming um I haven't
ever virtual reality games so I really
can't give you a strong opinion I'm it
seems like it would be expensive haha
like do you have any interest in oculus
rift Inge because it's still something
that's probably a ways away
I don't know well I guess maybe it's
closer than it was 10 years ago so I
don't know much about the oculus rift so
okay I can't really say all right I am I
think I think the lack of tactile sense
if you yeah you could look around but
you couldn't really interact with things
sure I think I think that might be
annoying mm-hmm I have a worry that I'm
going to have the same problem with that
that I have with regular 3d in which
which is I'm a man who wears glasses so
I cannot put another thing on top of my
face without it being uncomfortable like
right now I'm wearing headphones and
that's uncomfortable because they're
pushing up against my ears you know
and pushing my ears into my glasses into
my skull yeah by the timeout timeout is
like the greatest weapon since the Uzi
used it and make me proud okay
now I'm back to where it was are there
any video game based movies you enjoy
watching no not particularly
that's it all right I'm trying to think
of there's actually been a piece of one
ever for any game
I mean Super Mario Brothers obviously
it's the greatest movie just I mean in
general
Jeff would make a great addition to the
team great what a my thoughts on final
fantasy
it's a JRPG and I wouldn't touch it with
a ten-foot pole ah okay
well then there you go the RPGs famous
for a repetitive boring combat series
where you have no control over what
happened I'm just kind of on the rails
oh that's great let's grind boring
battles I know what I know what I need
to do here people settle down I think I
know what I need to do Oh
damnit I think I know what I need to do
I'm just not doing it very well I think
I need to get in there and shield him
yes I did it i Shi lit him and I rescued
him everything's great now what did I
think of his work I basically never
played an excerpt it's just a little bit
too late for me
my my my adventure gaming started with
the Sierra games your King's Quest
especially your space class I love Space
Quest fuck you you've never played any
of those old adventure games Jeff no no
I have not
you wouldn't hate them I don't know you
would know you would flatout him sure
promise Lee I don't know because I know
it would no you know what adventure
games I'm okay with because I get it I
get what they're going for
and so I can because they literally are
nothing but story I my feel like I can I
can be okay with them if that makes any
sense
my winning and because they usually do a
decent job of of having like interesting
character or stories you know whereas
other games try to find the middleman
between games and stories I mean yes I I
definitely played quest for glory one
but I was one of my favorites actually I
played that what I'm still just called
hero's quest they actually change the
name at some point I don't remember why
it was having some ghetto rights issue
sorry jack no no worries I'm just
playing I had to do that
okay well glory quest for glory two
might be my favorite adventure game of
all time Oh
you are the time okay great mess with
the bull you get the horns great or not
great I think I'm at my first boss Oh
nope nope I'm not
Oh what
must have camera those
what did I play the new region as for
glory - probably not
I played whatever one was came out first
I played him what it was to do out at
the time so whatever the earlier version
was that's that's what I played Jack
why'd we burgers from the best of the
worst episode did we eat those burgers I
hear you there but how can you hear me
they're asking about the burgers yes the
the funnier is well that's the funny
answer yeah so yes we absolutely all
those burgers and the we ate the VHS
tape as well no we did not eat any of
those burgers actually filmed on my
birthday
mm-hmm and we actually had a little
cookout before that what you saw before
cooking
we're leftovers yes yes
Boop oh no I suck at this game you're
saying which is cutting in and out it
could be just because my Internet's
wonky sometimes my internet just cuts
out briefly mm-hmm it's stutters kind of
like a loose connection like Steve's
temporarily like you're offline I'm
gonna go right back on sure that's a
normal thing I think that happened last
time too where it's like you were oh no
you were like glitchy and that happens
oh yes I know I'm running into them
again I'm working on it people I am
officially working on it okay I know I
know I know
I'll Jack a chat saying at least
somebody in the chat is saying this game
sucks um I tend to agree with it's very
complicated I'm not I'm not feeling this
game I'll tell you one yeah there's a
there's something here that I want there
we go if I sound tired it's because I
filmed for space cop all day no I'm now
I'm here talk to you guys so appreciate
it fuckers
ha ha ha I do I appreciate that you're
here oh I think it's great that you're
here I'm excited that uh that's right
yes them good that we're gonna be done
streaming you the night somebody's gonna
message me on unseen we're never to say
no I'm really disappointed that you
didn't like five nights at Freddy's I'm
disappointed in you personally yes
that's absolutely the case I'm
disappointed in you personally you have
rich you failed us
no come on oh now I'm not gonna get the
thing right cuz oh dammit not gonna get
the time thing there's time things rich
here's the time thing okay oh my god
right that's actually the part I hate
about this game the most is that it's
timed and I get it that it's like super
time force or whatever but damn it I'm
just not feeling this game second shot
that's something sure you know I'm sure
all of my scenes shot now it's Rob
almost almost there's one little scene
we need to do with me and then one
slightly larger scene basically two more
scenes with space company one of them
one of them should be really short
mm-hmm feel fairly easy that's great
that's great
and then there's gonna be oddball things
we need like dope
shot of building X exterior sure shit
like that mm-hmm
and then a just a shit ton of
post-production work yes dude finish
building models scream so much post
somebody is saying it's time so that you
use your time warp abilities are not
that advice I'll Jack I'm just reading
things I know I'm sure I'm sure there's
a very good explanation for it being
timed I'm just not feeling it
and I'm also not winning which is very
frustrating oh wait
somebody's asking if I've got a new
computing box yet yeah that'll be the
next major parties yes can't wait I
can't wait to get my hands in a new a
computational box
I hear they use magnetic disk disks now
oh is that true punch cards yes oh
that's great news
oh wait did that get rid of all of my
past selves oh damn it Jack you're not
utilizing your entire team and time warp
I I know this is my problem with the
game except I'm not utilizing my entire
team in time warp that was a calm
comment I think they're just trying to I
know I know I know it's you know for me
playing it's very frustrating because I
know I'm not doing the thing that I
should be doing and I don't I just don't
get it I don't get what I'm supposed to
be doing
oh god damn it I gotta go back I think I
have to go back in time more I think
this is my problem I mean John oh my me
this guy which is PC is so old the piece
short for punch card haha nice okay
there there we go there we go
oh good I got extra time I got more time
god damn it
so he's asking it from making space cop
intentionally bad I wouldn't say that I
mean it's gonna be somewhat
tongue-in-cheek just like everything we
do
oh hey we have a new subscriber check
the channel um I just started what the
fuck
rumbles fugly thank you
we very much appreciate your
subscription no Andy and by the way you
cannot make something intentionally bad
well sure like I suppose you can right
shark that's thought that's sharknadoes
thing is they decided to make something
intentionally bad well there's there's
intentionally bad and then there's
tongue-in-cheek
yes well you're just kind of playing up
the silliness you know it will be in the
style of red letter media basically you
know all of those half in the bag skits
think that kind of tone just from what
I've seen oh man there there are some
scenes that I'm so excited for people to
see rich and I know you you as well yeah
but oh man there are some things that as
far as I'm concerned our movie making
funny and which I mean like they're so
funny they make the movie you know
you're right on time I get ya this this
is try this game is trying to be cute
and I'm not in the mood let's you know
that Ridge okay I went to the past and
built this little
okay
marry fucker killed George Lucas 1980s
George Lucas mid-90s or George Lucas now
oh my god that's well you kill you kill
the 95 one right because then you stop
prequels from happening and then you
just don't have to worry about it
because then he's dead
you uh you marry wait what were the
years again and now I guess you fucked
fuck 80s why not no no you think you're
thinking about it wrong though you
married the 80s one before he's super
famous so there's no prenup so you can
divorce them and have a shit ton of
money then of course you have to fuck
modern-day Lucas but that's worth it cuz
you're rich ok see I was thinking you
know murder in the 90s one stop prequels
right and marry the null one because
he's gonna die soon yeah we get
everything you get everything I know but
he's rich now so he'd have you sign a
prenup he's the kind of asshole that
would have you sign a prenup but but
that's that's for like a divorce if he
just dies that's different right
so you marry the past one and then kill
know then again by the way you marry the
past one and kill the 90s one so yeah
you married the now one you kill the pet
the 90s one well give her the People's
you you you marry them the NA one yeah
obviously this doesn't make sense cuz
he's killed him a 95 he'd still be dead
but it's fucking game okay
see marry the NA one then he dies then
you get everything
uh-huh and then you just left over in
1980 so I guess I guess fuck just you
know it's left over so yeah I don't
especially want to fuck any incarnation
if George Lucas yeah yeah I'm with you
who do you prefer modern Lucas or modern
Shem Elam Oh God they're both completely
irrelevant to my life
i-i'll be honest I haven't seen either I
don't think I don't think I've seen me I
haven't seen red tails and I haven't
seen woes modern cha Milan he did The
Last Airbender I haven't seen either oh
so oh so unfortunately I cannot make
that call I'm sure they're both terrible
cuz I mean I like watching movies out of
time out of time can't damn it oh I get
it
I get what I'm doing wrong I'm doing so
many things wrong rich is it that's the
right answer so that's good I'm reading
the chat and talk to you and I'm not
looking at the game much at all that's
fine dumb
Jesus
damnit
damn it damn it damn it okay this guy
I'll take care of that oh there's a slow
down thing I want that check why don't
you play a real game for once instead of
these 2d pixel shooters cuz you know
jack to be pixel shooters
they're not real game no no they're not
real games at all you know I like 2d
pixel shooters and obviously I know
they're not real games and I guess I'd
do it to piss you off I do it just for
just for you because only lowly battle
machine 3 to 2 knows what a real game is
goalless battle machine 322 they make
that decision yeah yeah yes it's what
they like and those are the only
acceptable real games
yes I agree and you know what I'm gonna
go ahead and agree shit son of a bitch
rich how many hours how many hours in
your life were spent playing farmville
uh zero farmville farm gold back back
before they let you have multiple farms
hmm my girlfriend actually used my
Facebook account to play farmville maybe
she wanted another farm oh my god so I
don't know if they store farmville
records anyway are my fiance's hahaha
she made a Facebook page for her dog
haha so she can have another farm oh my
god I don't think she's played that game
in a while but she used to be she used
to be a farmville addict back in the
dating back into farmville heyday she
was know that she was in on the ground
floor I don't know if that's something
you should be excited about necessarily
okay I think I think I got this down now
so my other means gonna get that one I
get this one and then we just beat them
faster I want to say I'm understanding
this more the more I play it but I'm
just not this is the truth
rich why aren't you camping out tonight
for call of duty advanced warfare days 0
launch edition because I have taste oh
my god
oh snap you just snap them rich I did I
did
just snap them right in the right in the
schism in Grim Fandango yes or no well
yes yes definitely yes
yeah rich has a lot of love for Grim
Fandango I was actually upset when I
found out that the current remastering
isn't a full-on remake cuz I already own
you know the original I don't you know I
guess it's nice that the remastering
good but I could play that I could play
that game whatever I walk you know
yeah I'm with you I'm with you I'm
excited because I I don't have the game
right now and so I'm excited about
getting the game in general and playing
it on my Vita is gonna be fantastic
whenever it comes out if it comes out
I'm sure it'll come out and eventually I
did it rich
I won good for you jack
I feel no accomplishment I'm gonna tell
you that I don't feel I don't feel like
I've I've overcome obstacles I'm not
feeling this game officially I'm not
feeling this game well how long do you
want to put into it this is how long I'm
putting into it you're done now I'm done
right now okay so we take it a break
we'll take a little break
and we'll start up Monaco oh okay they
play in different time periods that's
fun it's gonna take a look here this is
the home of the time travel engine great
Forbes Argo Bay shards
oh sure so it has like a in-game economy
unlock stuff yeah great
super exit force yeah uh hold on
Hey look at that alright look at that oh
you're not seeing him I just uh
semi-enclosed it I closed it and and now
the B just wait y'all me drawing a
crocodile oh I thought you're just
excited because you closed the game Hey
look at that if I had the ability to
send this game back I might would bud
we will probably need a crew for Monaco
I think rich and I have not played two
minutes of time into the game is what I
have so our our first playthroughs is
just gonna be rich and I so that we can
kind of learn the game and then I think
once we once we figure it out then maybe
we'll open it up to a couple extra
people maybe we'll see we yeah we'll see
um why is that a green dog
I have no drawing ability whatsoever so
this is the best that I could come up
with this afternoon don't you take that
shit Jack don't you don't you take that
one there they're criticizing your
drawing skills that's fun septa below
I'm unacceptable I am okay with them
criticizing my drawing skills cuz I know
I don't have any I'm hoping that I in
fact have so little drawing skills that
that they think it's it's cute that I
try so yes Jack draws like he plays
super time force poorly you're correct
i am i added the poorly part weight
promises were made about what they they
apparently missed it when you talked
about the angry video game nerd oh i
talked about that last week i know IRA
now for a quick catch-up before we take
a break i really did not like the movie
in fact i found it to be insulting ly
bad because I know that the angry video
game nerd he also does movie stuff right
and I've heard him talk about movie
stuff and I find him is talking about
movies to be generally competent so I I
was so disappointed by that movie not
like I was expecting anything great it
was just it was just really bad it's a
really bad movie it has so many flaws
that that it shocks me that it was ever
made like I can't believe it shocks me
it shocks me that like you know because
I think he kick-started it or something
you know and and that he put that out to
the people who backed it is shocking I
don't want to speak like great I don't
want to like make any personal attacks
against the angry video game Barrett I
just think he made a really bad movie so
that is all yeah Ben is all he I think
you're right he was running on pure
instance and it's very it's a lot
different making movies than it is
criticizing them so yeah that's all that
was that's kind of the the short version
of what I said last week that'll be up
on the youtubes or whatever that's true
you know what the AVGN movie was almost
as bad as red letter media movies I have
I mean like if if I'm gonna be a fair
critic like feeding frenzy right feeding
frenzies has some technical problems
mm-hmm obviously it's a no budget movie
I don't believe any of the problems are
in the story okay I think that feeding
frenzy is is a simple but competent
story told correctly you know everything
happens for a purpose all the characters
actions make sense right obviously it
was done for I want to say the budget
for feeding frenzy was $15 because
that's what they spent on my sandwich
the day I was shooting there so what I
thought I haven't seen it I'm just I'm
just not interested mm-hmm I mean I'm
not a super huge fan of that stick I
don't I don't begrudge him at all but I
mean
that character got old for me a long
time ago mmm it's like yeah I get a
diarrhea uh-huh and is here I get it's
got a movie and now you know good for
him
but just not interested in seeing it
yeah oh by the way Matt's be for 25 it
makes a really good point which is rlm
didn't ask fans to pay for feeding
frenzy and that's why you forgive some
of the negatives that's right
that's like there was I think there was
added pressure on AVGN because it was
fan funded and that kind of ups the
stakes a little bit I mean also yeah
they're two different styles of comedies
and I'm I agree with rich of 100% I do
not much care for his style of comedy
and then that's fine you know like with
any of our reviews or criticisms in
general if you like it I'm glad for you
I'm glad that you found enjoyment
I just didn't much care for it yeah it
was a $15 sandwich it was a it was the
the Thanksgiving sandwich have you ever
had this rich no it's the most amazing
sandwich in the world it's roasted
turkey it's it's it's downtown by the
bank one building I forget the name of
the sandwich shop it's an amazing
sandwich shop it's roasted turkey
stuffing cranberry sauce all on toasted
bread it's a Thanksgiving sandwich and
it's amazing it's a grace if you say so
if you say so I think the most amazing
sandwich would have some form of steak
and cheese on it
myself I mean no disrespect to steak and
cheese maybe some grilled onions I mean
you're just you just want a cheesesteak
just like you know there's other like
cheesesteaks great I'm not no no
disrespect to cheesesteaks the ultimate
sandwich is some form of cheesesteak mmm
you know it's okay that we have this
disagreement
hmm I oh by the way I agree like AVGN
was kind of stuck you can't make that
gag last a full movie yeah and this is
this is the thing but but also like
beyond that like if it was just the gag
that got old I that would have been
forgiven the story made no sense the
characters were inconsistent everything
failed about the head movie the jokes
fell flat and there were some there were
some funny ideas of jokes in the movie
and they fell flat and like the forced
characterization like his his friend
nerd falling in love with the girl
whoever has seen the movie knows what
I'm talking about at the last minute the
last two minutes of the movie is them
falling in love that's terrible anyway I
don't want to talk about that anymore
let's take a break and I'm gonna refill
my water here and then we'll watch and I
will play so Monaco and Rey so hey watch
me draw some crocodile 9 brains
for like two minutes

[Part II]
you once heard people praise grownups
too I just I don't believe you I think
you're lying to us that's gonna be fine
your perspective is all yes critique my
mspaint drawings more I am gonna work on
both line brain and crocodile brain
emoticons they're probably gonna look
similar to this maybe I'll have rich
draw them because rich actually can draw
I work with a guy who loves grownups -
I'm so sorry I'm really sorry
you
what director has got better later in
their career that's a good question
you know I think any director who got
better later in their career was also
good early on right where it's like you
can look hold on for a second biscuit is
trapped in here
sorry but this cave got trapped I had to
let model um you know like early
scorsese's a little rough and later
Scorsese is just perfect and beautiful
Tarantino once he got money just
polished polished everything up
visca cam absolutely there you know
there's a lot I'm trying to think of a
like a director who was bad at one point
and then and then got good I don't know
biscuits on board right
why Sanderson you know like what
Sanderson like if you look at bottle
rocket you could see what Rhett Wes
Anderson was going to become and I think
he perfected it with Royal Tenenbaums
but really that was just kind of like
polish that wasn't like getting better
that was like having the resources to
achieve his vision who's a director that
was bad that got good
who said polish was good polish can be
good
is good polishing their ideas not
necessarily like apology I'm making it
look good it was just like solidifying
your vision as a director Wes Craven
right bottle rocket is greater than
Rushmore is greater Grinnell that's not
true bottle rocket is not the best mm
Tenenbaums is the best Rushmore is a
very close second
classic Spielberg or modern scorsese
classic Spielberg 100% classic Spielberg
that man had imagination I I really like
classic Spielberg
modern scorsese is great I mean he's
just always great modern Scorsese slash
any Scorsese is great Scorsese but
classic Spielberg oh man that's my Jam's
how is Zelda coming along fine is rich
back yet and radar you back in
he's not rich is not back in rich
someone's asking house-elves is coming
along the Zelda episode we actually just
shot the discussion over the weekend
so I'll start editing it hopefully I can
have something out later this week
the interesting things are interesting
so that is all I will say we I don't
want to spoil the the review for you
we'll talk about it after after the
reviews up we can talk about it more in
depth
when is space cop coming out tomorrow
space cop is coming out tomorrow
spoiler alert they just shot the last
scene this afternoon so Jay and Mike are
dual editing tonight tomorrow morning
I'll probably get some roughs and start
doing effects work and it'll be out
tomorrow afternoon possibly like early
evening
I didn't see love and monsters so I
don't know what breed is my cat my cat
is a Siberian IVA I have a long-haired
Siberian cat which which means which
means that he's hypoallergenic what they
were asking who's there who is this nice
um so the reason that my cat is a
Siberian is because he's hypoallergenic
and I have friends and family including
rich Evans who are allergic to cats so I
got one specifically so rich could still
hang out at my house and he has yet to
be over the big jerk the cats of my
friend bought a cat I told him it was a
fucking asshole it would it would be
fine yeah I've had people over who are
allergic to cats and they've been fine
with no medication you're gonna be fine
fine the special peanuts it'll be fine
it'll be fine
I used Windex on that all of the
surfaces it'll be fine no I'm sorry
important question of why are a lot of
the old RLM videos not working anymore
old Plinkett reviews aren't working that
can't be true
if they're not up on YouTube that
they're still on the blips check about
they're fine everything's fine they're
up or you know a lot of times blip has
player issues so if if you're watching a
harlem video player and it's not working
try again the next day they have they
have server issues all the time that
blip Oh Rach when did you get here you
were you were cutting in and out and so
I I heard some random guy talk it was
weird
I just got back Oh some random guy yeah
I just heard it was really weird it was
almost demonic the signals got crossed
that could be that was probably it yeah
yeah
that was probably it okay hold on I'm
gonna okay rich let's start up Monaco
I'm starting it up starting at Monaco
right I never argue I got I never turned
it off oh well we tested this then there
you go okay Monaco coming back on I
haven't been able to get the Phantom
Menace review to play in over six months
on blip that can't be true I'll let Jay
know about that yes what the fucking man
what the fuck in Monaco I think what
you're asking is what the fuck is Monaco
Jack Monaco is a place and you can't
fuck in it I'm sure you can fuck in
Monaco but the question was what the
fuck in Monaco and I don't think that's
a real question just putting that out
there
so Monaco I have bought also by the way
I don't really know what Monaco is I
think it's a stealthy thing mmm I don't
know
are you making a Lobby or something or
you know what you're doing I am working
on it okay
are you in are you in Monaco yes okay
look at lobbies yes I am creating a
Lobby nothing is there and check now

these characters do different things
yeah so the locksmith is very fast at
picking locked stores and save the
cleaner can knock out unsuspecting
enemies the pickpocket has a pet monkey
that collects loot the lookout can
detect distant enemies while sneaking I
think I'm gonna be the lookout okay
because I want to detect distant enemies
I also know pre prereq has never
reviewed Monaco right yeah what do you
think jack cleaner or locksmith I would
say locksmith right if I can see enemies
we can sneak around I mean if you're
fast luck picker it's a good thing okay

reference I'm sure that's going to be
the entire game
you should press why now why oh I don't
know what happened rich favorite Zelda
game um either Link to the Past or wind
waker third place would be twilight
princess yeah twilight princess is good
i really ever fuck I really enjoy that
princess
it's another powerup item use it with Y
to get through oh I hate this already
organ trouble I told I think Oregon
Trail needs to be like a group stream
now right doesn't doesn't it no oh I
thought we were talking about doing that
as a group stream what difference does
make I wouldn't need to be a group oh I
think I don't know I just think it might
be more fun that way no because we
wouldn't pay any attention to the game
mmm hey actually probably would not work
as well as a group stream oh okay
group streams are which play games that
you can just kind of like I'm just
simple games platformer or action II
type things just some people could talk
long game is going on sure
I'm with you I guess I'm with you also
why does he have a pumpkin head
Halloween some games mister eggy kind of
thing sure that makes sense
it'd be nice if you could turn it off
yes that would be nice
it's just oh fuck
whatever okay so Oregon Trail all right
hold on yeah okay I'm done yeah oh by
the way did you see you'll see this in a
second to turn it off there's a fucking
option so I I kind of love that no fuck

the bell tower mmm and they're floating
around the other bells and you could
switch places with them oh that's funny

it's a giant game Jack which did you
spend less time playing AVGN or alien
well obviously AVGN like played a lot of
alien yeah it on my steam it says I've
only played 11 hours of alien which is
true on Steam but then we finished
playing on the ps4 so that's why I keep

finished on the ps4 for full disclosure

in DC if they have any sense that is
we're gonna need a way to get around oh
Jesus
and I love Russia too much thanks for
subscribing and great name let's see
we're gonna need a way to get around

reliable but you'd be surprised that
Ruby they are anyway let's get moving
okay here we go
they want you to read it in French are

broken arm what goddamnit Clemens oh
Jesus Clements was bitten by a zombie
well get let's kill him and you are out
of fuel okay
just as the station wagon runs out of
fuel you coast into the city you can
hear a radio blaring in a nearby window
repeat all survivors who still remain in
Washington DC the government has
declared a class three biohazard in the
area there will be commencing a nuclear
strike within a few short hours get out
while you can the city is lost it looks

more of you get more of right right ammo
and food is a big one med kit med kit

jumps out in front of the car
great oh and you can even like stop and
scavenge for supplies any time oh hey
opto see thank you for subscribing we

this is pretty fun hey rich hey it
worked
I'm fighting zombies rich for money this
might be the most fun I've ever had this
is great I'm I'm kind of loving this I
think I love it really is I'm not doing
terribly well shit
shit
I survived the attack yes I did it I did
it
can you guys hear rich now oh not again
oh you know what I need to do anyway I
need to update this dream
hey iron $34 where it's quiet again okay
hold on hold on everybody
organ trail director's cut all right I'm
stopping the stream and starting it
again
dick neutral says what do dollars matter
in an apocalypse and I agree with you
some privates that's my major problem
with this game too many people are
willing to accept money for anything um
it should have been food because then
you'd have to think hard about whether
or not you want to give up food and food
should be harder to come by it makes
sense like there still needs to be some
sort of like currency exchange oh shit
are you finding the lost thing damn it
oh I tried I died okay I did I didn't
die I just didn't make it okay you lose
health oh so you got to be careful about
that right uh let's see what we need
here I don't know do we need anything I
don't know just your supplies er I'll go
to the auto shop and that's in the town
there are special upgrades you can get
for your car that have different effects
No okay I guess you should just I just
want you to know that that's something
you goodbye I don't they have anything
good or anything worth buying but a soup
our last muffler less likely for muffler
to break I don't have a muffler in
general so yeah I suppose some towns
have like I figure what they call our
combat master guy and you can you can
get like combat II type upgrades sure
sure
goodbye a fuel why not I'm not I am not
backseat gaming I am just explaining
that game works
big difference big difference sell scrap
oh all right I'm gonna go into the next
time I'm gonna see what happens okay
okay you must cross a horde of zombies
in order to continue on this road the
Horde is in front of you and currently
large in size and appears to be docile
horde size large dasu wait to see if
horde dispenses break out guns and clear
path or attempt to sneak through I'm
gonna wait and see if horde it dispenses
okay oh hey that works oh no no it
didn't horde size is now massive and
they are now ravenous so let's break out
guns and clear path Jesus Christ
I'm not your party oh man I was overrun
and lost the fuel well let's move on
oh no I lost an hour bickering with
hello Draco hello he's son of a bitch
sparks shoot out the back of your
muffler it's dragging on the road time
to replace it a kid wanders by trick or
treat you give him for fuel
this game isn't Halloween mode like the
Angry Video Game Nerd one was that's why
some of the plum the zombies have
pumpkins on their heads yeah but I don't
want to give a kid feel know if someone
farted rich someone farted the car stops
and it said someone farted there's a
fart joke in the game and I kind of love
that off we go
off we go Oh another towns come up I
think I can't damn it you can click on
this stat screen cuz ever as as time
goes by mm-hmm food is dwindling and
you're on fire Mike dwindling and health
is dwindling all right so you know
you're moving food is being consumed
sure
oh no we're good with food we have uh we
have a ton of food med kits ammos good
tires
we could probably need another muffler
um oh I can scavenge yeah oh okay great
scavenge at any time yeah oh I got
something this is just in this one
screener Oh
see what's going on so there's a big
pumpkin oh that's that's food that's you
collect pump that great those are the
things you scavenge they pop up sure
dodging zombies oh okay well I got some
food great okay

combat techniques for scavenging in
small towns at the combat drain oh oh
okay I get it

grizzled stranger beckons you to in a
dark corner Oh a chance not to use a
bullet when you fire yeah I want that

it right now because I'm watching it
away but I'm assuming it says 80 oh geez
I want that you can you can sell things
for money and it's Gavin uh no thanks
just don't die because if you die the
game ends
sure I'm sure I believe that you can
lose people in your party just fine but
if you die it's game over not and yes if
you haven't noticed the the character
model is definitely Sean from Sean of a
deck the other characters are this one

think that's good I have in a way I have
more than enough food and med kits are
fine like I said it's like I always want
to sell something because they have a
they have a combat trainer that gives
you the ability to have fine med kits
but I'm not too worried about it what's

me one med kit and I was like I don't
need one med kit I you must cross a
horde of zombies in order to continue on
the road the Horde in front of you is
currently small in size but appears to
be agitated but I can automatically
fight through does it actually give you
an option that says that I'm yeah it

you did so I don't want to do that do
they have feet do they have ammo they do
have ammo I don't have any I don't have
any money I can see that so I might need
to do the job to get the money to get
more ammo but then that uses my ammo so
