for player to join I had assumed there's
only five bucks by the way I had that
soon as this would be a like a same
screen multiplayer review why why would

to kill ourselves enter it
oh oh oh it just tell them we're good
nice the air vents or teleports you're
in the kiddo you're in the kitchen now

I probably didn't kill you though what's

the baby
the baby's probably in its crib so we
know it can teleport to the kitchen so
get to that kitchen Oh yep look I
already in the batteries okay
this baby knows what's up no grab the
baby put it back in this crib
can you grab the rivet hey I would grab
the baby I cannot grab the baby oh oh
you grabbed a knife nice put it down
oh you locked the oven oh he's eating
batteries
well how much we'll just hop him jack I
don't know
what's right play baby so baby got a
fork and electrocuted himself so you
can't grab the baby Oh your baby has
left to find a new daddy well be too
easy to grab the nephews grab the baby
and hold on to the baby I suppose and if
something the baby has a huge advantage
that kitchen is the key that kitchen is
the key to all this it's gotta be
something I can do and you grab him
batteries from under there cuz you know
that's easy that's number one how my
crouched and I knew pretty good by
region you can reach them from there
no I can't again there that's not
helping
this has got to be about I can jump you
can pick one up and you just have to
pick him up one at a time the baby's
gonna kill himself by then where's the
baby
I was tense that baby's probably still
upstairs I think you got a new baby that
baby's right upstairs just thinking
about how to kill himself it's gonna
fall down the stairs slack
check in the room just looking don't
open the door okay he's been here shit
he's in the kitchen
yep okay he's in the kitchen
run dead Oh got that hammer from the
baby you can't have that hammer you need
to figure out how to drop things hold on
let me uh look up how to uh controls how
do I drop things I'm looking that up
controls for look just follow that baby
pick pick up again are you duck soir oh
there's a swap well I need power I can't
do anything jack I can't even duck Jack

green
ruined I can't drop things I'm gonna
hammer my hand that I can't put down I
get up I'm getting there I'm getting
there rich I'm looking up the control or
just quit the menu let's look up the
controls run direct grabbin
grab drop so he or the left or left
Mouse clip is interacting he doesn't
drop anything you can only swap is there
there's got to be a duck so I can get
lower right you know use the left hand
item I don't think there is rich Hey all
right let's keep on keeping on those it
no I'm saying I'm gonna keep right on
keep on
developers didn't know how to code in a
duck that's probably true this game is
in alpha
there's another creaking button no
there's to create came poppers maybe uh
I'm just one crate game button is needed
look they go yeah baby
you can do this you can do this you can
do this you can do this you can do is it
procedurally generated I don't know that
makes sense
what
I want the vent oh yeah you need the
vent the vent is that clear I like
getting to that kitchen is the clear
answer unless you can oh oh daddy knows
what's up already it's in his hand don't
care you can lock the cabinet you fucker
go up and grab that dildo can you close
the door this is hurting me I would
assume it is yeah there's the video well
what's the green thing in there I'm
suing this health which doesn't appear
to be going down I just give it a second
I'd assume locking yourself in the
fridge is suffocation
I've seen that punky brewster episode
is that true
I don't think it's fridges working mm
probably not yep
open fridge go out and jump on glass is
what they say oh you ate the trash nice
have to figure out how to lock those
batteries up ooh everything's looking
funky oh let's just about jumping on
glass open up the fridge and just see if
it's like you can reach up or something
or jump up or how can you jump on that
glass up there yeah you might be able to
make it up to that second shelf
all right now what yeah can you like
jump on it again break it no jump up to
the next one
no that's not working Oh fresh one you
didn't because he's doing you're doing
okay great
oh the glass table no this is not the
only thing on the agenda our plan is to
play this until you're already bored you
guys are already bored of it I just it
seems like so far oh so how do we lock
the fucking things sure right look at
all the drawers and see if you can find
a so lock the oven isn't an option
yeah up on the top see the red lock oh
oh that you can save the baby I think
good that other locks the other dad had
a lock that he locked the cabinet with
gotta find that find our fucker baby
right with a dildo somewhere like babies
do checking the room but it's class
story glass windows is he in there no
he's not he's small it could be in the
corner let's wait we don't know that
that
being the baby is kind of fun yeah being
the dad is just frustrating
we got the hammer how do you where'd the
pills go
they're in your hand still right no
they're not in my hand can right click
the pills vanished from my hand after I
grabbed them oh oh oh yeah like he broke
through baby girl he broke through last
you can do this rich I don't think I can
okay great I think being the dad kind of
sucks I mean it's kind of what it you
know it's a lot of work it's a lot of
work and responsibility so in any case
we're gonna play this for a little bit
until we're bored of it and then we're
going to continue our undertale
playthrough until we get to did you say
that no oh it's gonna be under to lunch
at once they in turtleman's there too
come on doesn't have another channel
there's no I'm stuck in the drawer we
did someone someone last dream gave us a
tip open ice with the express purpose of
us buying powerball tickets with Oh
dad's in there already
okay okay
dad doesn't know what's going on it
doesn't know what's going on
and so when ten o'clock about 10 o'clock
rolls around we will be we're gonna take
a little pause and check our Powerball
numbers
why is everyone about Powerball because
the Powerball jackpot is 1.5 billion
with a B and so everyone is very excited
about that jackpot found yourself Oh Oh
dad I'm still gonna die from poison he's
schmuck oh he's trying to trap you in
there daddy your dad and we you have no
chance of winning it and I would not
have bought tickets if it wasn't for
someone literally like giving they gave
us a tip and and said you know buy
Powerball tickets with this and so we're
gonna do that because it'll kill some
time it's gonna die her that's all I'm
gonna do just gonna die up here that's
Jesus oh I'm sorry oh oh oh there you go
hey Dad I drank a bunch of boys and oh
he's got the pills Oh your daddy gives
you a pill
is it enough no oh yeah your your health
is not going down anymore if if I give a
tip explicitly to buy particular liquor
will you and Lord Belmont yeah sure
absolutely
that's kind of what the tips are
therefore I don't know if we can get it
here but I will try
you gotta find more events that's I get
nice locker rooms

I think it's doomed I think I'm doomed
to live
be sure to either garbage there you go

drink it I you know oh there you go nice
nice rich yeah you know what those are
nice back and forth tried to save you
you tried to die that was a great game

you also tip enough for a taxi ride home
because I will not drink and drive but
yeah yeah good night on the couch might
be able to get up there I don't know I
don't know we're safe from the baby is

checking that baby he's probably in that
be in the kitchen already
I'm gonna find the locks yeah where did
that guy have that bottle there's the
fork put that in the sink
oh well no you have it I guess oh wait

the pills and then then it'll be in the
drawer there you go there you go there
you go is that baby what's that baby
doing rich I don't have any idea what
the babies it's that baby doing
Lord Belmont hey you hack frauds didn't
print enough space cop blu-rays I was
ready and willing to give our alumni
money but none left that's true
we'll have more shortly we'll have more
shortly very sorry for any inconvenience
where's the baby I don't think I don't
think anyone was prepared I don't think
anyone was prepared for how much people
wanted this
the pills are knew he could price off
the knife for another pill oh there it
is
nice reach nice Fritch locking them up
Oh where's that baby was that a shadow
is I think the baby might still be in
your bedroom when the pills go they lost
her pills
what how did baby die I don't know I
don't know why my pills keep vanishing
how many have we sold so far I don't
know the exact number all of them we've
sold all of them there were many boxes
here before and now there are none where
did that baby find that fork you can run
yeah baby run baby run can you open the
door you can yeah that dad's gonna go

where he thinks you're gonna be oh I get
it one's a health meter

they no longer have them eat glass nice

irritated where's the smoke detector Oh
interesting
learn to power I heard a thing

gotta wait for the baby to grab it first
I guess cabinets
he's up oh I might be randomized
oh yeah and I could see that I could see
that it was a kid when I knocked it over
I and I I knew I was gonna knock it over
yeah you know I had that thought before
knocking it over like yeah do I really
want to knock it over people you know
you guys might get annoyed but I decided
it was worth it for entertainment
purposes and obviously if it would have
broken I would have helped repair it all
right but pills pills pills well right

pills where's the baby
why busy eating stuff already probably
yeah what would you do if you were the
baby

if here's the thing if George Miller
probably thought he had a Mad Max sequel
worth making he'd be making it he
wouldn't be saying I'm not going to do
it anymore
absolutely so the fact that he's not
doing it means he doesn't have any great
ideas for it and okay don't do it that's
that's that's the right hole that's very

that's pretty smart
oh he did good he had done he done did
good it's not it's not keep you alive
forever it's just keep you alive for the
kid yeah yep
that's that's that's that's one plate
yeah we need to see if we can get that
dildo I agree what is it with you people
I mean seriously with that situation oh
here comes the baby there's a cabinet
block anyway yeah I can see that
interesting going for the poison oh no
going for the fork grab that for grab
that fork nice
you got the fork he doesn't know he
dropped it thank
nice okay what a baby easy drowning was
he drowning
nope I'm trying oh he's a drinker poison
yeah probably drinking poison wait no I
did it back there but he's in this
closet you took the vent you think now
he's under the eyes under the sink
that's what it quickest poison is yeah
there is
I can't talk how do you crowd fry
tonight oh yeah there is get him there
yeah well I'm sure he drank the bleach
after that nice yeah we played this game
before our baby
Oh
get more fruit more fruit
go bitch go bridge go oh he's a sneaky
little bastard they're saying control
okay might be a to crouch as the daddy
quite possibly control aah Chinese New
Year well Happy New Year for the year
what is it what is this year in Chinese
the year of the dragon the year of the
pig the year the rooster the year of the
Banksy's
right behind him right behind him you
snuck in there snuck in there it is the
year of the dildo year of the poison
baby it's more entertaining that should
be it really is like I could see if we
got a couple more like some different
levels some more randomization and some
more ways to kill yourself but it does
once you figure out all the ways to kill
yourself there's a nice balance to it
remember sometimes it's in the living
room
if there is more he fully forked it the
fork the fork was everywhere year of the
space cop fuck yes the year of the space
cop I can't wait until people see space
cop fridge
I've watched I've now watched space got
four times why mostly because I can and
genuinely I think it's funny it's the
movie event of the year it's the movie
event I can say that because the force
awakens came out last year fork anti
bleep boom quick for kill
if I tried cooking food with the frying
pan no this game makes me curious how
dangerous it really is to stick a fork
in an outlet most outlets now have
safety measures built in actually where
you need the two prongs of an outlet to
even open it up to electricity that's
okay okay so most modern outlets have
protection built-in if you can get a
fork in there it's still pretty
dangerous cuz it creates a metal contact
in that sense electricity to you yeah
you gotta go save that baby I'll try to
prevent the quick death Oh oh good
there's that and there's a pill right
there hey go find that baby now
baby banging okay where was it yeah how
what hmm
that might have been that weird death
thing or he might have been cheesy never
be on the other side of the wall behind
a counter something yeah yeah yeah I'm
not an electrician no I'm not an
electrician but you know we've had we've
we've recently done some remodeling as
you guys know and all the new outlets
are specialized outlets where they're
they're self closed off and you need
both prongs of your plug to be in there
in order to open it up it's a safety
measure
Oh interesting drinks and bleach
yep
he gave me a pill oh and it took the
bleach
and run run run run run run run ice you
couldn't get my hair the Crouch
animation is terrifying I agree
Oh Oh baby's going grab that hammer
right away boom my hammer my hammer baby
nice we're gonna we're never going down
rich you gotta find that baby get out of
the closet baby we love you for who you
are
where's that baby
yeah gotta buy some time so poison but
that'll buy you some time
where are the stupid locks I hate those
box check I'm sorry baby I might be
trying to drown himself Oh No
just drank more poison fine will not be
fine
what are you doing rich what's the plan
um find the baby and sure him behind the
couch is nice he's got a key I don't
know if he can stick the key in an
outlet
you got this rich you got this nice OOP
oh he's dead
you got to get more fruit in him you got
to get more fruit in him go fruit it up
rich fruit it up little fucker he's a
good evil baby nice that bought some
time that bought some time
Oh God pick it up and do it rich oh
shoot the baby with the gun hmm what's
his locks never spawn mode there might
you know awesome noxious I don't I'm not
sure this game was designed for
longevity and I can't even see you guys
working it nice
stealth mode he went in the bathroom
right yeah into the living room have II
didn't think to go upstairs
Oh fork outlet go I don't know if you
can pull the tv down on yourself I think
the baby tried to do that last run and
we just kind of saw it not kill the baby
so but do the do Badoon you pretty much
expected never find the locks that's
random yeah that Fork is overpowered
like the fork or that's why it like
riches riches main plan of outlet covers
right away is the correct plan because
that fork is an insta-kill
or what I would prefer is the cabinet
locked so I can keep him getting two oh
four cruisers usually on the cabinet
right then you eliminate a lot of the
poison yep yeah yep random
I know listen Elvis I know we're all
curious about the dildo we just want to
know what it does it's just a dildo
hiding behind the toilet behind the
toilet didn't answer you he didn't see
you that worked he didn't see rich
worked he didn't see you behind the
toilet no stay there what are you doing
behind the chemicals you check the
cabinet oh how did he find you you work
you gotta give you an apple he's buying
time yep nice even smooth motion all
right you got this rich you got this I
don't think he knows that you're still
poisoned yet but he'll figure it out and
he's coming for you soon oh yeah oh he's
coming he's coming he's coming oh I gave
you a pill get downstairs
welcome you can find the locks oh he got
ya you can still find a hammer probably
locked away drink some more bleach maybe
we trying to trap you with those yeah oh
he's just fucking around with it now he
got all the shit oh now he did I hate
you hate you dad
you know fun
uh I don't like you at all I believe
they're like a fork or knife and the
cabinet's upstairs could be wrong that's
what they're saying
cabinets upstairs there's drawers
upstairs button
he gave you a bell right energy drink
bleach again no yeah you're fine rich
hmm hey you want to take over no no
you're doing great you're doing great I
I can't or urban vermin I can't talk
about David Bowie it's sad it's it's
very sad I didn't I but here's how
little I knew about David Bowie I didn't
even know he was sick you know no walks
never a walk for me you know I'd never
much listened to his music I haven't
even I don't even know the last time
I've seen labyrinth
oh he's got nice he's got a knife you
sure yep
all right now else else pills pills
pills pills pills pills pills pills
pills pills pills I'm up there pills
where to go workout where to go
hiding behind couches probably yep yes
first strategy that's its preferred
strategy oh really
bullshit yeah he was in the prestige I
didn't haven't seen the prestige I I
there's just you know obviously it's
very sad when anyone dies but David
Bowie's life and death have affected me
in very little ways
if you grab the dildo you can smash the
window and break this cycle you're in a
cycle rich
people when your dildos I'll never
understand you people I can't even get
out that although it's because you're
not trying hard enough I really don't
want a dildo I think it's the honest
truth yeah
wisely I cannot pay them that was some
good design don't now the dad has had
time to childproof everything down here
don't let the baby pick up the deal
though Cheryl I guess you can stick it
to the bleach in the closet
oh nice oh is he's too busy
baby-proofing is he not gonna see ya
yeah boom boom double soap the soap
grounding wins the day rich I was
similarly jaded to near Nimoy's death
there there are celebrity deaths that
mean a lot to me and there are celebrity
deaths that don't mean anything to me
and I'm very I you know obviously David
Bowie was a very popular musician and I
mean even more than a musician and a lot
of people loved him and I get that I
really like golden years golden years
with that song is golden yeah whoo but
see the baby has a fork he doesn't
already fucked and so you know I
understand your pain sadness upset a
tude he's hiding in that cabinet
probably with bleach I guess yep in the
knife

let us undertale let me update the
strand stream the stream is room strong
strong
whoa who's your undertale select game
undertale okay and update whoa oh my god
settle down what time is it it is 9:30
what time is it boy that is a good
question what time was what times
Powerball do their shit we got a
Powerball Powerball I just googled
Powerball it's tonight
does that help nope that doesn't help
last stream we got tipped we got tipped
by just this guy you know he gave us
some money to buy Powerball tickets so
just this guy you know we did we bought
Powerball tickets with the money that
you tipped us for the Powerball
doo-doo-doo I don't know Dook Dook
bifida do ya when's the next drawing
when's the next drawing failed to start
app already running except it's not oh
well there you go
when do they draw the Powerball no it
says nine 59-year time so we have about
20 minutes hey current estimated jackpot
is 1.5 billion dollars with a be a
billion undertale with a 930 million
thinks under channels running values not
running it's amazing that's amazing
for some reason Jack wants to take the
lump sum you always take the lump sum
you'd never take a lump sum someone tell
Rick how wrong is why is it wrong to
take the lump sum no it's right to take
why is it wasn't right to take a lump
sum because in the end you will get more
if you take the lump sum and invest by
the time you can't because the way that
your your and your investments are
guaranteed to pay out rather than having
the guaranteed what sixty million
dollars a year for the next thirty years
always take the lump sum what does the
chance always take the lump sum I always
take the lump sum I think you're just
getting yeah I think you're blinded by
dollar signs you're blinded by dollar
signs now this is how I say people end
up miserable and broke after they win
the lottery this is why no no this is
why your palm take all those money and
then they do stupid things and money's
gone don't have any more oh you don't
need super thin but don't take all of
the money out of the spread out at once
don't write it out thirty years that
will and then you're dead and you've
still got thirty million dollar checks
coming your way every fucking year oh
it's you cannot you cannot will that you
can't will lottery winnings what do you
what do you care you're dead by that
point if you can't manage thirty million
a year the fuck is right of you you
don't you don't get thirty million a
year you get a lump sum a year or you
get you know so much here I don't how do
they do it jack is right for once
yeah yeah Oh jack is wrong rich is right
hmm also we obviously we won't win the
lottery
yeah even a simple even with simple like
even if you take the lump sum put half
of it in a basic savings account by the
time you get to by the time everywhere
your relatives has their little piece
you don't give it to any of your own Oh
your mother and your father and your
brothers and your sisters fuck all of
them your cold-hearted son of a bitch
see this is why Jack's wrong no this is
what Jack is a riches right
goddamn you can make two mil a year from
Treasury bonds right yeah simple secure
investments would yield a higher output
than the thing the lottery would give
you and then you would also have a
larger lump sum to do with what you will
and then you can do stuff like will it's
I I hope I hope we don't win so so we
don't have to have this argument later
this would be like a bitter violent
argument there's no argument when we
talk about what to do with this money
there's no argument cuz I bought the
tickets I wanted to do on the chance
donation on the numbers that that me
Mike James Jesse picked I bought them I
get the consent Oh
taking the lump sum and splitting it and
then you can do what you want
Wow yeah that's I'm making that go fine
it's fine everything's fine I always
take the lump sum that's the smart we
can google it right now
you do that I'm curious what Google has
it's a smart move no not what most
people do what's a smart move what does
an economist say what does what does a
the lump sum lottery do you take the
lump sum that's what I just Google first
first result says your Powerball winner
take our advice and take the annuity hmm
oh oh
best of all that's the very first result
on Google well there's no well that's no
no that's all because it's an article in
its news should you take the annuity or
the lump sum let's go to Business
Insider you do let's see here have you
found anyone have you found anyone
that's illegal working yet okay there's
curious if you take the let's see here
there's Eltham more after-tax dollars
then if you take the lumps out my page
here money management
Oh what
that actually just doesn't say anything
I was reading an article I just didn't
say anything
okay here's Business Insider we spoke
and I have not read and I had we spoke
to several financial advisers as to how
they would advise a client who came to
them after hitting the jackpot
the key question we want to know is
whether the winner should take all the
cash upfront or whether one should take
the annuity which consists of more money
spaced out over several years but first
before we ain't sewn no not put first
nice
come on
come and get to the get to the good
stuff here
this is their burying the lede here
we've to do to do to do to do to do to
do to do scroll on the bottom of the art
of grain
okay according to our research if you
invest it all and if you can obtain it
and that well and if you can obtain an
annual return of more than three and
four percent the lump sum makes more
makes sense over the annuity thirty
years down the line okay
so investing it and getting a three to
four percent return which is easily
doable and that's it that's only
investing at all so there are pros and
cons but I would take the lump sum but
looking at their numbers they say they
say as long as you can get a three to
four percent return okay you take the
arms up according to Business Insider
your money if that means anything to
anyone okay undertale yes let's
undertale of course brokers are going to
tell you to invest
that's very true here you know what and
here's the actuality because we are
they're like you know because of one
we're not gonna win so it doesn't matter
but the this is 1.5 billion dollars
right before making any decision at all
the very first thing that we would do is
go talk to a professional
yes before before anything I would find
a money guy and we would talk to a
professional and and that professional
would lay out our options
so that'll put there that'll settle back
right there before we break up the
friendship over a non exist

[Part II]
okay let's go yeah where's the the
controllers on the floor
Freddie oh and then you're the undertale
guy I was playing a lot of who's your
daddy
okay I'll be right here I'm gonna have
that every one time I just want to touch
the trackpad so it doesn't fall asleep
are we potentially watching the end of
prereq no no we if we make it big you're
watching the beginning of pre-write
we're just gonna be able by a larger
fucking TV on our end yep and I'm gonna
give less fucks about what I say far
less fucks will be given it'll be it'll
be kind of amazing really we'll do the
stream so it won't be sitting in like
luxury chairs and we'll have like suits
on and like a monocle yes I'll have a
monocle and you'll have like the top hat
okay what can I have a tiny top hat yes
I'll give you a tiny top hat if you have
you have well we'll be 1.3 billion
dollars you want to give away half of it
but but you know you I guess you'll only
be able to afford the smaller fancy dogs
who invest it properly what this isn't
working like I can move this but I can't
trace it's not work
I hope both my front USB ports aren't
fucked
yeah be Just Peachy and we would buy
some sick-ass gaming rigs yes
know what I would have I would have a
liquid nitrogen cooled PC just because
just because let's reset the game again
can we close undertale it should have
think it already closed it no makeup
it's it's we I think we have to restart
I think it's I don't know here we go
everything's fine
Planeta okay we're ready
it all Tonto
okay dr. Loe has worked before press to
or enter
well you might have confused to bite
okay apparently I just need to get
through the menu okay wait didn't we
beat this person already did we not say
we say play
I thought we beat this person he did did
we not say after this for some reason
was just like the last thing we did I
don't think so do you remember how to do
this oh yeah I think this was one of the
last things we did and I think I did it
okay
there take this the controller's not
working so I don't or maybe it is I
don't know
undyne attacks
oh they say we never beat her youface
there many times I've lost oh oh is that
what happened earlier we didn't win we
quit yeah I believe that
she went like this rich she shook her
hand a Jew
Laroy
they're saying try to run away if you
can
how do we do that we hit back from the
buttons just not work with the buttons
oh I pressed B maybe just a doesn't work
maybe just the buttons are all mixed and
messed up you have to literally run away
into the cave
well I have no background there's no
back button
I hit that hit a you did that yeah so a
is back how do we see them today
it's better can you go back oh sorry I
hit B instinctively
we might die that was a big trouble yeah
be be is is forward you're about to make
a burger for lunch any recommendations

a big fan of a toasted bun with with
mayo for a burger for a burger toasted

great
we've just seen a burger Mayo salt
pepper boom that's it for me how are we
running oh I'm just gonna die
Oh bother saying last time we played
this you are at your wits end and ask
the chat what to do and they said flee
over and over so just keep trying to run
away no cheese real quick
cheese goes without saying that just
that's just a given
oh and you know what I just like you
know meat meat mayo bun toasted bun
toast your bun two patties two slices of
cheese some grilled onions some mayo
some lettuce and some tomatoes you have
to be red to flee oh okay great
exactly yeah chi Chi's kind of just
happens with a burger
I like Mayo I'm a big fan of mail mail
goes good on a lot of things here's
here's the secret of cheeseburgers the
most underrated ingredient the
cheeseburger is the bunt don't go cheap
on the bun don't go to the store and buy
just the cheapest possible bleached
white hamburger buns right buy yourself
a nice kaiser roll or if you're really
if you really feeling fancy the best
thing get some good French bread it's
probably not gonna be grocery store but
like you're a big French bread and all
shit any french bread any fresh bread
that won't get hard is a piece of shit
crusty you need that crutch yep like
Panera Bread or somewhere like that or a
real bakery I'll get some French bread
yeah and then you you cut that like you
would a sub sandwich really smaller and
you make it like a hamburger bottom yeah
that is the best bun you could have
what's a nice man he's talking he's
talking you listen and toasted I like I
like to toast it you know I adds extra
crunch it soaks up that juice for you
it's better to go cheaper with the
hamburger patty than it is with the
bunny now you're talking crazy no it's
not cows it's all County
you know it's all cow Marion I'm just
saying in level I'm saying just level of
importance if you could have a high
quality super lean sirloin patty and
like a White Castle bun see there's your
problem
your or you get the French bread and it
cheaper me you don't want the super lean
sirloin patty yeah I know you want your
6040 fat to meat ratio people make that
mistake
they think they think leader equals
better oh no it's the feather of Demeter
Laver when you leaner meat equals drier
yeah you got to find that balance
because if you get too fat it's just
gonna be sloppy and look this dusting
60-some you have some percentage that's
not super lean yeah I'm telling you six
sixty forty forty percent fat sixty
that's a lot of fat that's no that's the
ratio that you will find in the best
burgers I don't know if you can even
find something that fat at grocery store
that is a lot of fat that's perfectly
forty percent but I'm the fat stole a
good thing in this
it's normal 80/20 80/20 some nice Chuck
sixty-forty is just ridiculous you can't
find that make it happen make it happen
80/20 is the norm really 80/20 is the
norm go 70/30 then I like fat like fat
things enjoy fat food in the mouth
I'm saying that that bun is gonna give
you a huge upgrade in burger quality oh
absolutely absolutely
now I mean I it's quite possible I'm
wrong about the 60/40 thing everyone
seems to think I'm alone oh no oh good
you're right now
well okay
6040 is what they list as cause of death
oh and I could be wrong I could it's
better it's been a while cuz that you
know I don't need that much ground beef
anymore you said I used to have burgers
more often
jack is wronger about 60/40 than the
annuity versus lump sum watts settle
down
obviously we would get professional help
right away and obviously it just doesn't
matter because we're not gonna win and
that's the most important part dude dude
dude dude - thanks Dante for hosting
lump lump sum and veggie burger dick
neutral get out of here the veggie
burger you know what I do like to do
there are some tasty veggie burgers I
like to put a veggie burger on top of a
regular burger yeah cuz like that veggie
burgers usually have a lot of unique
flavors to put it on top of a regular
burger and then you got yourself
something I got it yeah soon as I can
yeah you guys have any guilty no no I
want to flee do you have any guilty
pleasure of fast food places obviously
what's considered a guilty pleasure or
something you're embarrassed about
something you know that's bad for you

anywhere near it anymore either of these
plate there's two places that are just
okay Mickey zeros okay yeah back in the
south suburbs channel in oh fucking

a slice that was like a quarter of a
fucking pizza at a free drink
I thought that was the shit
you now read I mean I am a forever
sucker for McDonald's breakfast I love
McDonald's breakfast with a very real
passion whoa
but Taco Bell I mean I also love taco
bell I love a lot of food which is why
for a long time I had a weight problem
so that's the real thing
but now it's just out you know whatever
what I do have stay determined when I do
eat terribly now it's it's usually pizza
I love pizza
classic slice here in Milwaukee the best
beach ever there's this place near me
that has pork fries which is a a bucket
of french fries and on top of those
french fries is barbecued pulled pork
and on top of that is like this cheese
thing it's not even a sauce it's thicker
than a sauce and on top of that is bacon
and jalapenos and it's one of the most
delicious things ever it's an appetizer
it's meant to be like shared between
five people and I just ordered that and
eat that for dinner because it's too
delicious
I remember I remember we got a we have
to she has to swipe at us and then
that'll turn our heart red and then we
can run away and we started talking I
got distracted right
oh no and I'm telling the chat that
pulled pork booty it's kind of like both
a pulled pork routine yes and it's
amazing it's amazing if they told you
that you could only claim your lottery
winnings if you ate everything on the
menu at Pizza Hut in 24 hours would you
do it yeah I made a 1 duh of course
unless it was like under are you are you
allowed to throw up cuz it's my you know
I might not be physically possible
no I'd do it and I think I could do it
too
Pizza used to be my like pizza of choice
until I moved into a neighborhood that
had decent pizza places there we go you
got you got you here you got it
I remember as soon as you run away
fuckin run go go go nice nice nice okay
do I know what is AMA beats up menu now
I have not been to Pizza Hut in so long
because I live in a neighborhood with
three good pizza places
broom juice as drink choice I like you
know so I had this thing when my
children were babies yeah something that
was very important to me was trying all
of the baby food with them as we were
feeding them baby food you know if
you're gonna eat this all I want to know
what it tastes like - and obviously
grown up some babies tastebuds are very
different but it's just like what does
strained peas taste like oh yeah gross
but something I actually really enjoyed
was mashed prunes
like baby food Mashburn's like if they
would need it I just would because it
was so sweet it was great
so mashed prunes I give it a thumbs up
remember I said now run and just run
again yeah
and nice okay you know I don't think we
have any heal items and I'll actually
check if you have any items oh you have
a bandage
ain't 40% fat my beef and I eat mashed
prunes right just one of those things
there's some really gross stuff baby
food wise by the way it sucks to be a
baby yeah they don't have the taste buds
that I know that they don't have
anything they can't they can't form
coherent bodies they shit their pants it
says oh it's not everything about it
just sounds awful yeah being a baby
I really hope there isn't reincarnation
yeah oh oh
people are saying the pie oh you're
right it is the Powerball time it is the
time for the power ball's you get you
get that ready I'm getting that ready
I'm refreshing the page right now we'll
see if we won a billion dollars the
answer is no spoiler the answer's no
as you can imagine the page is having
some trouble loading I wonder I wonder
if anyone is checking this page right
now hmm like you know everyone in the
world winning number is one two three
four with the Powerball as six I hope
not because I jokingly want to do that I
mean you kind of have to write
I might have made it otherwise yeah but
as it is
okay
now the first five can be in any order
but do they have to be in the right
order our community I don't know these
things
yeah I can be in any order I never play
the lottery because I know statistics oh
yeah I know math it's a dumb you never
ever play them I know math literally we
only played because someone gave us the
money to play and said please play come
on Powerball dot-com 1.5 billion yes
it's absolutely hiring I thought it was
yeah I'm nine hundred and thirty million
cash value that ain't nothing that ain't
nothing to bargain
ding-ding-ding
hola we're checking ladder numbers
we're loitering
okay just in winning Powerball numbers
are 4 8 19 27 34 with the Powerball of
10 so far we have no power balls out of
10 so we didn't win the jackpot no
matter what let's see if we want
anything my guess is we won nothing and
that's you know what we should be ok
with it it's my money damn it it's my
money all of it was your money I don't
think we want anything and I think we
want anything oh my god we won nothing
as it turns out we did what a twist
what a what a shocking twist this is
both shocking and surprising here's the
thing though
for like a buck we got to talk about
what we were going to do with the money
back for a few hours that's true
for a buck that's true we had some nice
back-and-forth we had a little nudity
versus catch some discussion that was
great yeah that was you know what that
was great times oh shit oh that's okay
did you make it in the cave no no
because I'm just talking no correct
thing to do is diet
and try again okay because I made zero
progress in all of that I'm so sorry we
got two numbers there does that give us
anything
no the the least amount with no
Powerball is three out of five if you
get three out of five numbers you get
seven dollars Oh
so that's what I'm looking for now oh I
got one here that's two out of five but
no Powerball so that doesn't help us
yeah
come on I want this one to do because
they give it to you in like a miracle
order rich just kill her they're saying
just kill her yep I mean you don't have
to listen to them no I'm not going to
you don't have to
you could dude frequently when possible
except in FTL
I tend to take pacifist options in games
yeah that's fair oh and other people are
saying don't kill her I mean we've been
playing this whole thing pacifist yeah
so I say continue pacifism we didn't we
didn't win shit I don't have to pay
attention to what's going on and ignore
everything else here's a Power Ball card
we didn't we didn't waste your cash
value zero 1/100 of a cent cash value
negative negative I guess we have to
continue on with our with our lives as
they are
oh how sad
what's four out of five if you get four
out of five yeah you get $100 but if you
get four out of five with the Powerball
it's 50,000
Wow that's pretty nice and if you get
five out of five with no power balls you
get a million dollars independent of
what the jackpot is yep and then five
out of five with the Powerball is the
jackpot yeah well there you go
well there you go
we'll sign them and sell them on eBay
for 50 bucks there you go
now you're talking
what do they usually know if somebody
wanted well in their computer system I
can only imagine Maine Owens right right
when do they announce it they probably
want to be verified double-check some
stuff this time I ran soon enough great
basically we just wait for like the news
outlets to start freaking out it's in
Tennessee the winner was Osama bin Laden
what it's not the real Osama bin Laden
just a really unfortunate
here's the thing what if it was the real
Osama bin Laden do they give him 1.5
billion dollars he's a criminal they say
you have to come here to collect it in
person literally the entirety of
Powerball has all been a giant has been
a decade-long ruse in order to catch
terrorists I love it
love it
oh damn
someone won nine hundred dollars from
the lotto great congratulations my
friend spent around two hundred and
eighty dollars and made 82 oh man the
lottery is full scam
suckers any sort of gambling the the
deck is stacked against you it's it's a
it's a terrible thing gambling at all
it's your year it's more worth your time
to not give your money to Institute's
like that obviously this we haven't all
fun we got a little entertainment out of
it gambling not good for you nice
days in lire says I want $50,000
congratulations great what are you doing
here still go collect oh wait did you
win fifty thousand does now or just like
years ago either way congratulations
one in 292 point two million that is the
odds of winning Oh God that was crazy
I hate this fight yep
Oh Drazen said oh you want it on fear
factor oh cool I think fear factors that
you have better odds and fear factor
than in the lottery I think about one
playing this game and he weren't you
want to kill her I want to get health
items okay is there a shop around yeah
back it might be a shop how can I not go
yeah he got caught on the British for
some reason er he see whatever it is it
got caught up on the bridge whatever we
are whatever we are right we did funny
voices what no one's been talking I know
so I know once someone is that oh oh you
have to go back through this bullshit
maze thing
oh wait I did fight whoops
yeah I never understood that about fear
factor like the whole eating gross
things you know cuz that was usually the
thing as like a some sort of feat of
strength eating gross things and then
you know another feat of strength right
yeah so the evening gross things to me
that being all enough and stuff like
you'd see someone eat like a couple
bites of a horse penis and then give up
just like what listen once you have one
bite of a horse penis you're kind of all
in there's no uh needing that bite of
horses just keep eating the rest of the
horse penis you know yeah
you've signed up for this okay oh you're
playing oh wow how did that happen oh so
it's just the a and B mixed up is that
to attempt I don't planning on having a
stream Fredro that dragon cancer and
everyone just cries for four hours oh I
know I've heard I've heard heartbreaking
things about that game federal taxes
forty percent you take home about five
hundred and fifty million from the 1.5
billion if you took the lump sum no no
well you sure cuz if you took the lump
sum you're actually taking home nine
hundred and thirty
government taxes then fed then fit then
taxes yeah
they still say that if you invest that
wisely you would get riches just on his
period what am i doing that you don't
like today what am I doing wrong I got
frustrated in a fight and undertale I
had fun playing uh who's your daddy
because I'm not bouncing off the walls
tonight apparently not but see that's
the thing like you'd only have 550
million that's my thing you only have
listen rich has been busy all day
packing up space cop stuff
Tiberius Kirk says then you pay taxes on
the income you make from your
investments so you're paying taxes twice
on that shit while the annuity is
tax-free income right but I'm not a
young man anymore that's net makes it
even better
it means it's definitely gonna last you
the rest of your life yeah but it's not
just about me I got babies to worry
about I imagine they'd have to give you
the rest or someone that can't be right
I believe that is correct that can't be
right
I believe that is correct I don't know
so that nine hundred million isn't with
tax already deducted no no that's why
you don't take the lump sum you can
double fucked
you're not you're not looking to go help
oceans you're looking to stick this one
out no that's fine that's fine
trainer you just see what happens
I have no problem with that except they
think the game is just too hard which it
isn't when did I ever call the game too
hard I wanted to get a more and more
health potions because I'm having
trouble with her attacks because we keep
losing to her so we were hoping Wow
everyone's just everyone's just catty
everyone's you know why because they
didn't win the Powerball they everyone
just discovered that they didn't win the
Powerball so what are we talking about
that's super exciting Jack our ball did
you have you read Batman versus an
economist or ever is you two just came
out yeah it's pretty good maybe I'll
look into it what it's done in a trade
paperback yeah that's a good idea
it's pretty good I'll tell you who are
they fighting in issue 2 also like
they're fighting Batman
so like the turtles the shredder and the
foot Master Splinter are in Gotham City
and Batman is trying to figure out
what's going on has he met the Turtles
yet and what was his reaction he met
them briefly and they fought for a
little bit in issue 2 which was awesome
how did that work out right I'm not
saying and shredder is tossing the
penguin around like he know which is
great well yeah he's great
what you cut work what kind of nobody is
that I guess it's no continuity oh yeah
this is just in my turtles world the
ship the shredder got the tech
decapitated a long time ago

heal item and I use it this is why we're

do you get her to stop and swipe the
other thing you have to just keep doing
her fighting her again and again and
again I always plead challenge makes her
speed up yeah but I think that also
makes her swipe at you faster Hey you
keep doing you keep doing that I just
have to wait no matter what oh okay I
don't know how this game works I don't
know about this game can't blame him for
fried something he was trying to figure
the game out it's a valiant effort you
know why because we're losing trying to
figure the game out because we're losing

would write oh there are my hair is
what's yellow fire my guess I don't know
I don't know you survived that get up
she's sweet jeebus Christ
which what what do rich-rich I what do
think about Rocksteady into new Ninja
Turtles
he's stupid just like he wasn't the old
cartoon look when it comes to the
turtles of a comic-book guy an old
black-and-white comic book guy bebop and
rocksteady I don't give a shit they're
stupid I can't I can't
here's the thing I can't appreciate a
villain that's just too stupid and
incompetent they're not a good villain
at that point they're just Schmucks yes
this is why I hate cartoons Skeletor and
when I played with my toys
Skeletor was nothing like he was in the
cartoon I'm winning crop which in run
away I couldn't possibly be menacing
Rondo stupid oh hi so the Blazers all
these here the blue lasers won't hurt
you if you don't move orange ones oh
yeah you have to be moving and they pave
the way they well they they they won't
move through those ones it's like a good
goodbye
that's a youth orange you have to move
for once you don't move for blue okay
um do you think rush can I do the kraang
voice once again not up Turtles cartoon
guy I don't know if I can do the crane
voice because I'm not not as fluent in
80s Turtles cartoon it's just my pitch
there's something robot voice in the new
Turtles cartoon we will be standing in
the thing where we stand in the place
where we stand in the thing yes that's
music that's amazing
what
shit
was toys Skeletor a three-dimensional
villain from a rich well I was young
enough I don't know if he was
three-dimensional but he was at least
menacing he wasn't a coward who would
who would run away yeah
you just missed
whole bunch noodles
now they're talking about Thundercats
Thundercats hadn't eaten villains and
meet villains in general yeah
but the Thundercats themselves are so
fucking lame
I couldn't never get into that show yeah
lion-o was a dumb boring motherfucker
every other every every hero on that
show was a dumb boring motherfucker and
snarf was like super Jar Jar before Jar
Jar
that's how bad snarf was fuck you snarf
you know who I can do a really good
impression of what snake us the northern
door will stay locked until you solve
the puzzles I'm on the right and left
eye I think she could go do that to the
right first
the way to work is blocked and so I had
time to catch mettaton show on my phone
the special effects were amazing today
that human almost looked real medicine
yeah he's the most populist on the
underground his hand glove probably has
at least two no three dozen members I
grew up in the are these days a is's I
grew up in the early 80s but I was
always a gargoyles fan yeah D'Argo's was
a great job I liked it at the time I
rewatched some of it recently I don't
remember why but I've ever watched some
of it recently yeah I think we were all
basically just seduced by by Keith David
okay cuz he's just he has a phenomenal
fucking voice the show was okay okay re
watching it I have not seen it since a
child it wasn't amazing really good
compared to a lot of other cartoons it
was great okay
what
Riker and Troy voiced on gargoyle yeah a
lot of team and basically everybody had
an appearance on gargoyles from TNG at
some point except for Patrick Stewart
and I think that's because he wanted
money generally speaking I'm gonna guess
they wanted him to play the Macbeth the
the Scottish kind of Shakespearean one
does Patrick Stewart is Patrick Stewart
Shakespearean actor oh yeah and I'm
gonna guess he said my one more than
this what are you offered me this
pittance for you'd be gone with you but
the rest of your ghost as indeed I don't
give a shit they suck but I think that's
why I watched it in the first place
finally turned up that later now we're
friendly we can well oh you little black
belief is repetitive representative lay
with me there
you read my mind by the way I was gonna
do that before you start alright
