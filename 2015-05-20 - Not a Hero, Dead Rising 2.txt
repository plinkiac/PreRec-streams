[Part I]
It, it totally looks like a Jack game.
But I wanted to play it.
And Jack's not here.
So I'm gonna play it.
It's called Not a Hero.
And I've only played this game a little bit.
And I have, I have since reset it.
So, here we go.
Hit the play button.
All right.
So, that was Bunnylord, a purple bunny man.
If I had a song called Purple Rabbit, I would've played that instead.
But I don't.
The_rising_sun, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
All right.
So obviously there are a bunch of unlockable characters.
But the only one we have right now is Steve.
So we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna play this game.
The echo is, is totally minor and acceptable?
Okay.
Then we're gonna deal with it for now.
All right.
Left stick or D-pad to move.
Easy enough.
And the, uh, A button does some slide-y stuff.
And, uh, this is a 2-D sidescrolling pixel art cover-base shooter.
As you can see, he's in shadow behind that, that cabinet.
That's, he's in cover.
So this is a cover, this is a shooting game, with reloading and everything.
And he says amusing things as you shoot people.
I'm, I'm fine.
It's not terribly challenging so far, especially with the regenerating health.
I'm assuming most of the, uh, challenge is going to come in, uh, time, doing it quick, and, and doing the little achievement things down at the bottom.
All right.
Ooh, special weapons.
They didn't seem to notice that explosion.
All right.
Tutorial.
Tutorial is done.
I did all the, the unlock things.
Landowastaken, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
All right.
We're gonna continue.
So, you say the audio sounds static-y?
Uh, DaveAA005, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
It's an okay game, so far.
Not much of a challenge.
I'm assuming the challenge is going to be doing the accomplishment-type things.
I, I don't know.
We'll, we'll see.
TourGuideNixon, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
All right.
And we're moving on.
I don't think Jack would like this game.
Jack would complain about the cutscenes.
Uh, as far as where I found it, uh, Steam.
Oh, shit.
I'm dead.
All right.
Steve, not as, I mean, uh, not Steve, Cletus, not as good.
Not as good.
Gonna try again.
Always be reloading.
Oh, I suck at this guy.
Well, we're never going to, uh, I'm never going to get the, the five-kill streak.
This is, this is a disaster.
Burning people's nice.
All right.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna retry that.
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna get that under the time.
All right.
Restart.
We're gonna beat the time.
Totally gonna beat that time.
Out of bullets.
Out of bullets.
I'm out of bullets.
Oh, fuck it.
Fuck.
Restart.
This game is okay.
I, I, I'm worried it's gonna get old fast.
All right.
One more time.
This was, like, thirteen bucks.
Wasn't that much.
Restart.
All right.
I'm gonna try this one more time.
Did I say one more time?
I meant two more times.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
All right.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Twelve sec-, I think I've got it, I think I got, I think I got it.
And, I think we did it.
Whoo!
What, what animal is Jack marrying this time?
Oh, he's not marrying an animal.
He's on his honeymoon, with the bear.
He's, he's taking her to a circus.
I mean, that's, that's kind of sick, you know?
He's taking her to see other bears in chains?
I, I don't get it.
I don't get it.
I did not know I could've gotten this game on GOG.
That's probably where I would've gotten it.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
Owl warehouse.
I love their voices.
Uh, FearfulSludgeboy, I've played plenty of Bloodborne.
Let's see what characters I got.
I'm going back to Steve.
I'll take that range, and clip size over, honestly, I'm not, I'm not sure what advantage this has compared to the shotgun.
At least I got more killing power against guys like that.
I don't, I dunno.
Oh.
Ooh, owl.
Sixty seconds.
Oh, god.
Time to run.
Almost forgot to reload.
Something there?
There's nothing there.
All right.
Nothing there for me.
Go back down.
Go back down.
All right.
What didn't I do in the list of things to do?
I missed something.
I'm gonna try it again.
This is far more action, fast-paced than, uh, Gunpoint ever was.
There's some visual similarities, but not that much alike.
Oh, I can use the special weapon.
Oh, fuck.
Steve died.
All right.
Four kills in five seconds.
I'm probably gonna have to do that with the specialist.
Don't forget to reload.
Oh, shit.
That didn't work out too well that time.
Did I see any of the leaked Suicide Squad stuff?
No, I have not.
To tell you the honest truth, I, I don't really give a rat's ass about the Suicide Squad, so I haven't gone out of my way to, to look at any of the related materials.
It's kind of, like, eh, whatever, who gives a fuck.
Oh, shit.
They shot you off the ledge.
That was not stupidity.
This guy's packing much.
I missed something over therek, didn't I?
Hello, person who just said hello.
AlzheimerPenguin.
Ow.
Ow.
Regenerating health.
I'll be fine.
Dammit.
We're gonna do this.
We're gonna do this, goddammit.
Nope.
Nope.
I'll try a few more times, then I'll give up.
Fuck.
Oh, now I can't get the owl.
All right.
So I have to go out that way.
Rich Evans, can you say poo-poo platter for me?
No, I, I cannot say poo-poo platter, so do not ask me to say poo-poo platter.
It's just not gonna happen.
Can't knock him over.
Get four kills later on.
Fuck.
I don't think I used all those other grenades.
I wanna get those four kills.
If I don't do it this time, this'll be the last time.
Where you guys going?
Yeah!
What a weird grenade.
But a cool one.
Can I go down...?
Nope.
Sweet.
All right
All right.
That's not bad.
That's not bad.
25 pixels tall.
He shrugs his shoulders.
Punched...oh, shit.
Well, whatever.
Wow.
Okay.
She died quick.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
I don't think I'm gonna do it.
Get 'em!
All right.
That was bad.
Oh, shit.
Too high.
Too high.
That didn't work out like I wanted.
Yeah, it's just me today.
It's a solo stream.
Ow.
Don't get dickpunched.
She, I'm playing as Samantha right now.
She can't get dickpunched.
She literally can't get dickpunched.
It's the one thing that's not gonna happen.
Oh.
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch.
I, I suppose Samantha, Samantha could be transgender.
Whatever, whatever.
Fine.
If you reall want dickpunch that bad, fine.
She can dickpunch.
Cuz it makes you feel better.
Got it!
Did it!
Oh, I got punched, though.
We gotta try again.
I'm sorry.
All right.
No punches.
No getting punched, or whatever.
Yes!
Did it!
Going back to Steve.
Had a lot of luck with Steve.
Ooh, I can't jump.
All right.
Teaching me about obstacles, I think.
We'll see.
Nope.
Ooh, nice weapon.
Ooh, if you reload, it goes back to the standard.
That sucks.
It's a kill streak goal right here.
Oh, fuck.
Ooh, secret stuff.
Six of eight kill streak.
We might do it.
Doesn't say that there's a time limit.
All right.
Now we gotta find all the power-ups.
If I haven't fucked that one up already.
Killshot.
Came from here.
Oh, I, I did everything already.
All right.
Now I just gotta find the stupid cakes.
Sweet.
All right.
How do we get down there without dying.
I think I see it.
That's powerful shot.
First try.
Steve rocks.
What a weird game.
In a good way.
But what a weird game.
Look at chat.
Have we got, had any, uh, subscribers in a bit?
None that are showing up, but none of them have shown up, which is weird.
Let me disconnect.
Here we go.
All right.
Back to the game.
The game!
Fearfulsludgeboy, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
All right.
What do we got?
Less that 20 hits.
Six kills in twelve seconds.
Steal all the bonsai trees.
Except that it is not.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
What happened.
What happened.
All right.
Good.
We got the hard one out of th eway.
Though I might have missed something up there.
That's not good.
Probably missed a bonsaid tree.
I probably missed the other one in there.
Fuck.
All right.
Let me try that again.
Whoa.
Oh, he drinks, he takes a drink before he dies.
All right.
Nothing interesting over there.
Had to check.
Had to check.
Yes, this game does have regenerating health.
Oh.
I thought I was dead.
He can' slide?
Well, he can.
Why wasn't he before?
I dunno.
I don't understand.
I don't understand all of the mechanics.
Fuck.
Trying to get those six kills because I know that's going to be the hard one.
All right.
They're dead.
That's good.
I'm gonna have to be careful at the amount of hits I take.
Oh, shit.
I missed a bonsai tree.
Missed a bonsai tree.
Gonna have to redo it.
Sorry.
Ehh, son of a bitch.
No, fuck!
Nope.
Three more attempts, and then I'm just gonna go for the main objective.
I'm not gonna worry about all the side...objectives.
Oh, fuck it.
Fuck it.
Disappointing.
I can go back up?
Never mind.
I thought I might be stuck.
Fuck.
All right.
How, how, shotgun guys, difficult.
Difficult.
And he's a shotgun specialist.
Shotgun specialist!
Take cover, you...
Shit.
What, what game do I hate that I reference so much?
People reference things they hate all the time.
Yeah, Mass Effect.
I reference it so much because I hate it.
People obsess about two things.
People obsess about things they love.
And people obsess about things they hate.
Taking my time.
Doing it right.
Taking my time.
Doing it right.
I'm going to take this shotgun guy from behind.
Taking my time.
Taking my time.
This isn't timed right now.
He's not that, he's dead, so...

[Part II]
take the shotgun guy from behind tell
you what I'm taking about some time
no specialist nurse
hostile
this is neat like authorizing psycho
did it fuck yeah
you walk out alright alright Chad who
whoever him with a zoo Samantha Steve or
Cletus
this game is $12.99 Jack what's up jack
jack is not typing in the chat
say 1% - for hey-zeus and - for steve up
there's a third phrases for nowadays
oohs this hips don't lie
Jack Jack what do you think about those
games looks looks right up your alley
all right
note to self I cannot trip those guys
I'm spat
some people I get that out of you
you know you know I don't I don't stick
or talk during cutscenes i'm highly
enjoying because it better if you got
available if I can't surely oh fuck
Jack this is a 2d cover based shooter
like I am I'm popping in and out of
cover there that's okay I don't I don't
know that I'm in love with it but it's
fun it's that great sense of humor which
you would miss skipping all of the
cutscenes
all right find the gerbil ooh less than
100 shots I'm already halfway there
that's not good probably not going to
pull that one off and I'm
I see the Rising Sun does not like the
game sense of humor well I I do I have
laughed out loud several times not
really chest high walls Jack more like
ducking behind the cabinets it's more
like ducking in alcoves
like when you're grayed out you're in
cover like there's some kind of thing in
the wall so you can straight out
so now I gotta find a gerbil and the
reporter it's the wrong one get back up
my trap down here
oh well
oh well
all right I like the cat bomb
quite wisely
I think I'm rushing too much in this
game works a bit better one here a
little bit more tactical about what
you're doing
turn up
I missed I missed one I missed one
talk about the movie contact I I don't
even remember contact it's been so long
since I've seen contact it's a movie
there you go there's my discussion of
contact I hope you enjoyed this
discussion of contact it's a movie
starring Jodie Foster and some other
people based on a book by Carl Sagan
that's the only interesting thing I
could say which everyone knows already
so there's no point in my saying it oh
there's the Tribble hazers needs that
gerbil
what can I knock it back up I might be
unable to get back up
I don't think there is
rich how the fuck are you I'm just fine
all right I am something is missing I am
lost I did something wrong
something I don't know what I am unable
to go back up where I likely need to go
and things are generally fucked Jen
really fucked check it in this door
not over here Green Street right a Buffy
there's nothing right above me I know
I've probably moved
oh I think I see no it's green but
there's no there's no explosive option
all right Runa B says I I I like to
think I know a lot about games but
previously recorded live manages to play
games I've never heard of new hipster
fucks I'm not sure if that's a
compliment we try we try to play I can't
take you jack
sure he feels the same way I try to play
a decent number of different things
though I'm going to continue to play a
lot of dead rising because I liked dead
rising I'm gonna I'm gonna start playing
the second one at some point
no Phoenix I have not seen one spike so
far
spike free spike free unless this is my
gun there's a lot of strange power-ups
like there was a cat bomb I love the cat
bomb alright I'm just restarting let's
fuck it
you're outnumbered
you know what Jesus Christ for changing
characters this might be a job for
Cletus Lee the fire a limited number of
shots and when I inevitably play Dead
Rising 2
you're not gonna be in Odessa
where are these reporters that spoke
nails evidence
Oh
these Cornish where are the reporters
okay
I just
this this mission is totally a job
please
where are the reporters I want to meet
them stop right there oh the TV's come
it's a weird
what's the snob bridge from stealing in
a YouTube video of someone else doing a
no death run and talking over it like
he's pulling it off himself that's just
mean I wouldn't do that I like doing no
death runs in games you've seen me
stream a number of different failed ones
and you know you can you can probably
find the original online you can
probably find that and call me out let's
do this
nice
well duh
you've lost the wrong house
anybody who looks there's the reporters
all right now we know where the
reporters are I can go find them now
when did I start doing no death runs for
video games many years ago like a decade
ago just the way to games I absolutely
loved it was a way to give them a little
extra bit of challenge no wait I might
not be able to back up so
raise that
nope and I'm dead I'm dead are there any
actual games that might place no I I
haven't seen Mike play a game since
shitload of years ago I know I used to
like one of the the Star Trek flight
Sims I forgot which one it was
don't clean Academy bet he flies ships
did he like flying around the ships and
you did that for like a week he's the
only game I ever saw him play and that
was it for my kid games
time to get your lack they robbed a mom
yeah I don't know I don't know that
co-op really comes it's something he
played during the stream that once
they're less
what's the wrong house ma'am
Challenge gone
Oh
fail to meet those reporters again every
time this game is starting to get to
appropriately difficult which I like
now we're gonna try run without trying
to get any of the objective
got everything wisely
yeah that felt good don't mind if I do
nice babbling oh fuck
ice cubes not bad this game is growing
on me let's do this
you don't get that time
I'm doing my own oh I fucked up
which what's the first game you
completed a no death row for Maximo goes
to glory I'm gonna marry second one was
probably zone of the enders of time then
it would have been a ninja ninja gaiden
dumb one from Ninja Gaiden 2 9 did you
guys enjoy me knob Maximo - never been
able to pull one off for Ninja Gaiden -
I've never been able to pull one off for
vanquish try it a number of times with
both of those games
here we go
and you've all you've all seen me
pulling off for Dead Rising I don't
remember if I've done one for Dead
Rising 2
oh no I wanted to keep it made shopping
oh my god dammit
you might watch the fuck out of a
vanquish no death from but I don't think
I get pull it off I've never I've never
done it twice
jack is out of town
fuck hey some do oh my god
take care come lose my adipose might
well begs to us Steve for a bitter red
repo
Oh
and Canada Jim here they all want to
know when you're coming back
thank you Mike they all want to know
all right don't look mishaps don't allow
your not come back the hey Zeus oh we
can shoot and slide didn't let us say
I don't like those exploding bullets on
him that doesn't work out so well
let's pray came from no way back out all
right
kind of bad
I found the reporters
motherfu
right alright wait
I think that last time there was some
kind of
all right all right you did it it did it
in the funny wagon
how about
I'm trying to bounce this name cynic no
cynic douche Oh nein thank you for
subscribing we really appreciate it
it's growing really no five most alone
what am I wear my feelings on
regenerating home for the most part I
tend not to like it I don't like ducking
behind cover to heal I also games in
regenerating health usually means you
die quick when it comes to shooters I am
decidedly old-school
we'll try and unlock one more chair of
your
quarterly fabulous
you wouldn't know
right
allow me
this is bad
where we the hostages are time
that don't do good for the hostages
finding a lot of milkshakes though so
win
you would have timeless
I'm the one
they might be our god they say such
silly things
I am I
here you go we're doing the Sun
nope
I'm on there y'all record your faces
everywhere
Fiona Belmont say they should make a
game where you just clean up after
bloody action singing it's not really
action scene massacres but go online
well you're obviously online now open up
Google look up viscera cleanup detail
and there you go
all right
or do you walk out st. Helens
born-and-bred will try Mike out
oh he's got double-barreling three shots
oh my god thank you good thank you right
go vision complete
oh shit too far too far alright now this
one again and after this stage I think
I'm gonna take a break what do you guys
what are you guys thinking of this game
quality
who does that shoot through cover all
right that shoots through cover that
changes the game
now
ever power up he gets it's only gonna
have two shots no not again oh fuck fuck
I can't compare this game to grow fours
or does I've never actually played
broforce so if you're saying it's
similar I'm gonna have to take your word
for it
seems like a choose their cover oh
that's okay next make some kind of nice
alright be careful with this - cuz that
just goes all over the fucking place
please maintain some little add nope
there's no order land
right now that does not shoot through
cover for shame was here tonight he's
got a night I wonder if I can do
close-range kills
people
okay the knife is for this this Brown
takedowns I get it
all right we're getting it I'm getting
it it's making sense
it's not my favorite game ever that's
kind of neat
yeah I'm gonna be honest we it's not an
elevator action in the chat if I had to
compare the two actually like elevator
action more not this bad but elevator
action is pretty fun oh shit
give us a live look chat it's I don't
know what's going on with them but it's
best just to ignore them
far best just to ignore
thank you all signed rainbow

hell are the bad guys get around

pretty-pretty Matt the most terrible
thing
some islands born and bred
all right thing a big break
I will return stream will return where
I've done for the night but today debris

[Part III]
are we acceptable here are we and
unacceptable whatever level for whatever
for acceptability I don't want to spend
the next hour fucking around with trying
to fix audio and I don't know what the
fuck I'm doing with audio or are you
even seeing a stream I guess it's
another equally equally acceptable
question sounds great alright well I'll
take that all right it's nothing I'm not
even gonna try no death run because I'm
not I'm not familiar enough with the ins
and outs of of Dead Rising 2 so I'm just
gonna play the game there will be there
will be saving if I'm dying there will
be reloading
yes this first time I've played off the
record i clawed my way I will Ahmet
fought hard don't cover the truth of
what happened at that mall
things were good real good
while
I'll let things get to me
I let things get out of control
I think deep down
things got pretty dark
this is my chance to get back in the
game the song the opening song which I
love is called halfway dead you can find
it on the youtubes
the first mission is not to feed Reynold
he he died of obesity between the first
and second Ronald is dead he had a hard
time while choking on a ham sandwich oh
yeah I get it back in the games art it's
bad up what is it kid
I signed your waiver you got my next of
kin of a vultures circle and already
yeah
sorry sir it's just paperwork they want
it from everyone would you mind if I got
your autograph
sure
sorry about that it's just
it's been a lot
you've always been a big hero mine mr.
West I was really bummed when you're
showing off the air wow thanks
so I guess this be worth quite a bit if
anything happening out there tonight
yeah
I guess snow
good luck
this wasn't such a bad idea after all
Frank is doing a celebrity guest
appearance on a zombie game show it's
been I think five or six years since
dead lies in one
for a show rematch of all romantics
now Frank's gotta kill zombies to earn
cash bigger to death they're gonna pay
them especially if those corner Grimes
yeah I I kind of like that they aged
Frank he's he's a lot fatter and just
generally his face looks older but if
you consider that he's been fighting off
zombie ism he's infected it kind of
makes sense
oh god I don't have my old loose things
that rising one and it's gonna throw me
off
buying pants are killing me
salon the goal here is to earn points by
killing zombies the bonus points by
knocking them into the grinders
what the fuck indeed whoever you are I
will thank you later
Misner won thank you for subscribing we
really appreciate it that's true I
really know
yeah yes
yep my mate goddamnit
point at us I thought I would but I got
gold happy about that
no Jack tonight's just me
I believe I have unlimited help about
this first portion here
we're tired of us he's got plenty of
hair for all his faults in his weight
gain he still got here
games are okay I guess I'm new zombies
are popping up all the time they're easy
to replenish
fuck
je frisk - thank you for subscribing we
really appreciate it
the difference between this and regular
dead rising - well obviously there is
the the main character other than that
I'd like as first time I played this I
know they've added in some some
Psychopaths and I know there's a whole
new area of the map they added in like a
whole section other than that I'm not
really sure I know there's some some
story alterations but I've heard they're
relatively minor no this is not an O
death row and I'm not familiar enough
with Dead Rising the ad - to make such a
an attempt
I I will be saving and reloading I'm not
going to play through the whole damn
game tonight but I think in general I'm
just gonna play through this game did I
like dead rise or dead rising 2 more
obviously you've not seen any of my dead
rising streams yeah I'm kind of vocal
about loving dead rising one more but
they're both fine games
is the moral of dead rising to still
Americans are so fat now the moral of
dead rising to is that drug companies
are evil
all right I know they do the camera
really weird and this one
you're talking about sports fan costumes
is the first time I've actually played
off the record so I'm not familiar with
them
I'm assuming there are unlimited
pictures in this version
I gotta get back to my show
hey there boys you're late for the
autographs
get away
let me take a door
come on come on come on no weapons up no
weapons fuck fuck
what I got beat up
call me feel for a photo shoot
oh well
your performance
you must have to take pills
good night ladies
so I turn fast
I'm used to I'm used to regular dead
rising to isn't the daughter in here
decent axe just about set to break
though
I bet you still silly
50 guitar lessons
well not as fun as the Dead Rising one
guitar
you lost Dale what will we do really
you're gonna beat I figured he would
shove the newspaper in like the zombies
Bob
Jeremiah
all those to reflect
this runs so much better on PC that it
did the PlayStation 3 which kind of ran
like crap
oh and then in the green room you can
see that the daughters back oh no with
with blood smears
see I don't think the CDs are Shaun of
the Dead reference because the same
weapon was in Dead Rising one and I
think I think that came out before off
Shaun of the Dead been wrong before
shard the dead was 2004 Dead Rising was
2006 you sure the first one was 2006 I
guess it was
I know you could be name's Frank Frank
West
don't worry it's under control
Thanks we got these hombres here
military have to quarantine first
they'll enter the city at first light
three days from now that's the standard
procedure
so we're stuck here
No
I'm assuming this is um a shelter
designed specifically with zombies and
mine why the fuck wouldn't they have any
of the anti zombie drugs in the anti
zombie shelter that is the dumbest
fucking thing I've ever heard maybe like
you're the number one thing you'd want
to stock right right before food and
water
zomb Rex
I figured you were infected though I
don't remember you saying anything about
that in your book
advertise
there's a pharmacy in the Royal Flush
mall
I'm Stacy Forsyte by the way I'm Frank
Frank Frank West
but if you find one
and Frank if you find anyone alive out
there
game audio up I don't give me a second
I'll change that to second survivors
I do like the Bluetooth thing all right
I'm gonna turn game audio up
and while I'm at it change one other
thing
and risk fuckin up our son because why
not why not do that why not do that
stupid stupid thing makes perfect sense
perfect perfect sense
I didn't work for me but the audio
should be fine for you which I guess is
what's important
can't you Frank West bottled up
bread crumb gaming you're saying it you
you you're you you bought it on ps3 and
hated it years ago but now now you're
loving it on the PC it's probably cuz it
runs a lot better I know the original
Dead Rising kind of runs like Dead
Rising 2 runs like crap what happens if
you take Zombrex and you're not infected
I imagine it's just a waste I believe
Zombrex is just a a hormone that keeps
the zombie bee larva from developing and
your head so probably do nothing totally
not Jake thank you for subscribing we
really appreciated anybody else knows it
I'm caught up actually I don't think I
said KGB ate my bread thank you for
subscribing and also mr. won and fatty
Muslim thank you all for subscribing we
really appreciate it
I fell well I do whatever a number of
months in a row I'm sure it's something
exciting
no fun jump right in there show my god
zombie seem faster which I don't feel
about that I like slow zombies
nice slow manageable zombies
yeah they're still pretty slow I'm
saying they seem faster than they were
in the original Dead Rising - that's all
well so I don't like the blood effects
that that's straight line up blood
around his back that is just distracting
and oh god I need food apparently not as
that is easy totally gonna die this
sucks
fuck
how's he not dead
holy fuck holy fuck
not good those life-saving cookies Frank
eat them eat the cookie so they I think
technically I died already with that
opening part and the the henchman
characters this is totally not gonna be
no decimal
just leveling up oh fuck
holy fuck getting my ass beat redheaded
stepchild
fantastic
come on don't lie to me don't hey don't
you have something better to do why
don't you mind your own business old man
just looking for some meds well you're
definitely gonna need some painkillers
I'm done with you
well talking to you is giving me a
headache oh yeah
what say you give me some money and I'll
go get something for you yeah give us
some money grandpa how about it grandpa
you got any money
they sure think he's a grandpa now Frank
does not need to keep the old one
apparently they hint that the little
girl is dead so sucks to be a little her
that's weird their mouths are moving but
nothing this no sound is coming out why
bother why bother with live animation
that is so weird
weapon to give you a lady shut up
why'd you let's move
all right I've heard it's a little bit
harder to escort survivors in this one
so we'll we'll see about that
it could be harder this is the more
aggressive zombies I don't know
yeah look at oh sure I grasp they can
get they can get grabbed it off the
record more easy
that's that's the thing
I suppose hurry it up is better than
follow me
getting around is not as easy
that's right Frank
you'd be a jerk he saved need things
that poor lady he's just trying to live
oh fuck fuck
Oh checkpoints yeah whatever whatever
I never claimed this is a no death run
I'm not I'm not I'm not this is the
first time I've actually played off the
record I play Dead Rising 2 but off the
record is new to me and the new the new
button for throwing this the ring me off
- you're getting a better weapon so this
chair works out
that's the psycho the psycho noise is a
nice touch but wasting my time changed
up too much for the button you use to
aim and throw throw me : oh god damn it
I need a better weapon okay she's able
to get through a crowd with decently on
her own I like that that it's not easy
to us water all right all right I'm fine
with that
oh no dead front of us feeling
lots more difficult I think the dead
rising one I feel I feel very weak I
feel weaker right now than I do at level
one in original dead rising it's not
like he's such a jerk
keep up yeah the zombies are a lot
harder to avoid they're fucking me up
what is what is Frank West doing in Dead
Rising I'm out of the game myself I'd
you like the the Frank West model I made
is my mod I don't know if I get a
perfect job on the face and there's a
lotta people keep telling me it looks
like Dan Aykroyd but on the whole I
think I did great
move it
oh yeah you have to pay for the mod yeah
it's a $20 I put a lot of work into it
maybe changed a lot of things in the
game I I did you know like give her a
Katy and make it so Frank was the one
who's taking the Zombrex I mean I did a
lot of work
yeah so if you if you send me $20 I'll
just send you a version of the game with
the mods pre-installed we won't be able
to play the regular dead rise but just
send me $20 and I'll give you the modded
version is that cool
all right so what I don't know is does
he take the Zombrex automatically I mean
I know I made this mod and I should know
this
but let's just say I'm not sure how I
made it when I made it
hey keep up
keep up you jerk you don't get nowhere
near as many points with the pictures I
don't like that
give him a crowbar no I'm almost we're
almost there
it's a waste
what Frank Frank it takes selfies in
this one that sounds appropriate
as the game to loud now guys told me to
turn the game sound up I did you don't
like it let me know I'll I'll bring it
back down
all right bad sir by far the best one
oh they're so grabby in this one Wow
so grabby grabby amygz um bees
deadly anger ID I could I guess I you
know honor I imagine I could pull off an
a no death run of the original Dead
Rising 2 I don't know if I could do it
with this one it seems like they've made
some definitely made some changes to
make it more difficult which is fine
that's good I like I'm not if I want a
challenge
still personal tummies first up kind of
this will slow they're a lot faster than
they used to be say that there is what
he spend the money on there's a pawn
shop where you could buy fancy weapons
and and Zombrex and all manner of things
what off Jesus Christ outran me the
zombies can outrun you now
all right it's fun but it's very
impractical
and her one the vanilla version there
should be I like some guy who was
hanging out on these streets fighting
for his life
I don't I don't know what they changed
in this edition you're definitely not
saying any kind of icons for somebody
who needs to be saved
Oh in that ironic
one can I get into the make make a
weapon room back
what why are you going to that menu now
to pay the stick
what I want to see the watch just we get
rid of the watch how do I check times
things
what does the right trigger do change
things up I don't know what things do
now back check time on the map okay are
there no objectives for anything right
now wait you have to you have to do it
at the safe house oh that's annoying why
would he have to do it at the safe house
he's got the Zombrex on them just just
stick yourself with a needle that's dumb
I'm gonna go all the way back no I'm
gonna now I'm gonna die on my way back I
don't die from that I'll become a zombie
well fuck my nuts am
Oh guess you can't do it alright I guess
they didn't alter that from the regular
Dead Rising 2 because in the case file
and said destination safe house
this thing the broom doesn't break in
this one and turn into a much more
useful item
oh it does okay
stabs not quite as quick as it was in
one but I'll take it okay it's better
than nothing I'll take it
once this game seemed so much slower
well I imagine there are speed upgrades
you can get for Frank West that I just
don't have unlocked yet because you
start off Dead Rising one pretty slow on
my my my glorious no death perfect Dead
Rising run that I did just recently I I
did somewhat luckily get to speed
upgrades pretty early on so my walking
speed to pretty much all of that game
was good
roll them dice I'll roll them guys later
I want to get back to the case file and
son of a bitch fuck off probably save
while I'm at the safe house I'm just I'm
hoping I can say that save us that
second camp

yeah if shits if shit's gettin awful in
the chat mods you f you have permission
just to start banning whoever's where's
being an idiot
flat a bantam I don't give a shit I
don't know what's going on in there
because I got too much focus going on
with this game but I don't I don't
tolerate no shit
put lay the smackdown on them
outside I got kill I'm swimming 11
minutes in game time which shouldn't be
that long
all right I'll wait
all right ready to stab you Stacy any
moment ready to stab you
you just look look she's like looking
over her shoulder ever like what the
fuck are you doing what what the fuck
are you doing Frank West no I don't know
I'm gonna stab you with my broom I'm
gonna stab you with my goddamn room
broom broom that room broom you know
what I mean
am I going to do a perfect Dead Rising
to run probably not I'd probably want to
do one full run-through at least one
full run-through before I even tried it
just so I know when things you know just
familiarize person with when things
happen I mean where I need to be when I
need to be there who I need to save how
many people it's like a timing thing
your group's got a reputation but come
on your had nothing to do with this it's
pretty easy to say that
you're gonna need more than that
better start talking right now I'm
telling you we're being set up we've
been accused of things before but we
don't believe in violence for someone's
convenient excuse oh really it's not the
first time members of cure have been
falsely accused of being involved with
an outbreak I've gotta find
damn TK and his horrible show I'm not
saying I believe you something's not
right here that's for damn sure
I needed something to get back again
I investigate this maybe I get back to
doing what I do best that reported where
is she she said she was in the hotel
I know this could end up being a big
chance for your career
this could mean my life
person in the chat saying that the magic
of my dead rising one no death run can't
be replicated oh there will be other
games and other attempts I'm gonna do it
again and won't be with Dead Rising
again that would be insane but I'm
thinking either Ninja Gaiden Sigma next
or zone of the enders one but I will
certainly attempt a no death run again
there's a guy playing the slots in the
Americana casino he just keeps going and
going almost weird
it seems like I'm dropping frames the
the the game is pausing because every
time I hit right on my d-pad which you
have to do to answer the the phone for
some reason that that brings up a steam
in game menu and I don't know why it's
decided to make that Association I gotta
I gotta figure that out I mean I had the
I to jump through hoops to get Dead
Rising 2 off the record to recognize my
gamepad in the first fucking place so I
don't know don't worry about that some
other damn time probably got a play till
10 and then I'm done four out of ten
target six I think it's fair for hours
and there are spikes in this game
Phoenix are you are you around Phoenix
does you have it where you go one of the
few times I like spikes in a game
why is rich playing this shitgame
because he felt like it the only reason
I need
under the wonder if the secret Zombrex
is still in this game in this version I
mean in this version of this mod I made
so I know whether or not it's there or
not I'm just trying there you know space
nice ever I don't see the Zombrex Oh
oh no they got rid of the secrets on
bricks that would make the game slightly
harder
you know what I forgot to drive that
expansion oh well whatever to grab the
axe didn't grab the eggs forgot the eggs
excuse me
oh I'm not gonna be expected hey this
man
I kill him do I get the money back
let's move
and it's me what the map which was the
safe house we're pretty good with a
two-by-four keep using that 2x4
hey I'm waiting on you that's not the
way nope that's not the right way we're
going this way
I kind of like the zombies just at the
slots they used to be in life that's a
nice touch good evening John B 8:20 I
might I might wrap the stream up at any
minute I'm not sure what I'm gonna call
it but I'm gonna call him
maybe I'll just screw around until I die
that'll be the end
that's different
there's a gotcha zombie
be the boss first I'm not even sure
where to find the boss in this one let
alone know that I'm gonna beat them I
don't know I don't know this game near
as well as I do the first one sir
what do I save lady lady tell me where
to save I'm assuming I could save in the
safe room
it's gonna be a bathroom in here at
least right
can you not save in the safe room that
would be stupid
that would be that you know what that
would be too stupid to be true too
stupid to be true there's got to be a
bathroom in here I'm wasting so much
time looking for it
nope
where's their cot here this cop can I
save here no no no no
checkpoints I hate the idea of
checkpoints why save on my own like a
big boy when we grow up we learned to do
things from our ourselves and then they
invent checkpoints and take that all
away from us it's not right damn it it's
not right
whenever I restart a game that is loaded
from a checkpoint it feels like I'm
starting a different game somebody else
is saved not my own it's weird but
mentally that that switch isn't there
when I start from my own save it's like
okay this is where I left off
I like I like safe points where you go
to save yourself or manual saving where
you open the menu and tell the game to
save wherever you are I'm not so fond of
checkpoints I'll deal with them because
I kind of have to this is do security
box what's that I'm completely
unfamiliar with that phenomenon
yes I need to mod some safe ones I need
to mod out the checkpoints the automatic
checkpoints yeah
let's rock I could deal with autosave on
quick cuz they see you know I would be
quitting the game and if it started from
where I left off when I quit that I'm
okay with that that is acceptable
it's after 10:00 I don't know what I'm
gonna call him I'll call it at some
point
I mean I already think I screwed up a
little I'm not even a no deathrun but a
perfect one I don't like the fact that
I've dyed to those guys clearly on the
game just continued on like nothing ever
happened
that bugs me that bugs me get off me you
zombie scum I think some kind of yield
suit should be a combo item in this
woman the zombies can't grab you wear
like a slimy suit maybe you could like
combine Crisco with with some kind of
latex fetish suit and then yeah it's an
untouchable suit that's the combo item
there I just made a Dead Rising combo
item and they need to put that in the
game I need to mod that in yeah I'm
gonna mob that in when I get a chance
yeah I started at six I've gone for
hours already
Jack's not around because I don't I
don't have children so when Jack's not
around I tend to start earlier cuz I
can't under worry about putting someone
to bed you know do what the fuck I want
what I want to why the fuck not
duh ninety four nails
and I found nails
I don't resent Jack for having kids I
don't mind starting later I have no
problem with with the later starts but I
mean if I'm free and I've been nothing
particularly better to do I'll you know
I I'll start earlier I'll start a little
bit earlier
I'll see if that guy whoever ever being
outside and the original Dead Rising 2
was is outside by now maybe I just had
to wait
yeah you get the cameras like like
worthless now and it's I guess it's nice
that it's back at all but I'm getting
like so many points for this for using
these these gloves and I get like next
to shit for a photo 169 or I could punch
somebody and get a lot more
I mean if you're gonna put the camera
back in which I like make it useful
don't don't make it worthless
I guess that guy just doesn't spawn in
this version of the game
all right walk a bit further down just
to make sure I don't know there is I
think is that no that's a street sign I
thought that was a help so far let's
Street side I thought it was a health
bar it's not
my guess is upbeat meet Rebecca Chang
why the fuck not the most underrated
weapons that rising one is the purse and
it's better it's better than
off-the-record really great you move a
lot faster
boys by the rayna's own i'll girl
whatever it's fine it's fine
amateur looks like your zombie chow now
you need to pay attention out here I
know you you used to be a kind of a hero
of mine before you got washed up you
homesick for zombies what are you doing
here
Hey I came to help with your story I
think yours being set up my exclusive
tape says otherwise and I don't exactly
need your help
it doesn't have to be a contest lady I
help you you help me
where'd you get that tape from darling
reporters don't reveal their sources
Frank not real ones anyway
I wouldn't underestimate Frank West
sweetheart I got some pictures you might
be interested in
okay
see what you got
not so fast you gotta throw the old dog
a bone before he does any tricks okay
maybe I'll let you tag along for a while
that's more like it I can't tell you my
source but there is a central security
room
there'll be footage of everything that
happened there I can show you where it
is well you show me yours I'll show you
mine where's your
they ran off with all the equipment I
guess they just didn't want it bad
enough
that's my saying once again saved by a
woman with a pistol who shoots zombie in
the head glass moment technically Brad
did the same thing that's the third time
Frank has been rescued with a pistol at
the last minute
alright I'm gonna find out what the
security boxes do I have no idea so much
for that chainsaw wrote her what she saw
like a little shave ball room
oh shit I'm sorry Rebecca Chang
yeah
no at least there used to be I don't
know what they've changed but they used
to be a nice where you run off to face
oh that felt good that felt good
I'm not gonna lie I remember that
chainsaws were kind of bad in vanilla
Dead Rising 2 but I want to see if
they're more like they were in Dead
Rising 1 and off the record because that
would be sweet I missed the fun chainsaw
okay find one do they take it out of
that game nothing we're a few of them
just lying around in the construction
area
huh huh
that's my favorite zombie movie I'll top
my head original Dawn of the Dead I
thought about it for a while I might
remember one I like more I'm not sure
there we go oh they changed the colors
trouble now
now that's not as fun you just be able
to run and cut now you can't
it's like worthless now fucking I do
have what's that
don't worry I'm gonna get the paddle
what do you think I'm looking for the
combo room for
I don't die first rock
that fuckers in here right there we go
I know what vex stole the restroom I
don't care I'm making a paddle sob we'll
go back to the Rebecca it's fine
I don't think I'm don't think I'm doing
a hardcore playthrough right now I'm I'm
just kind of kind of playing seriously
kind of having fun was it bad
where's mr. Chang
oh I'm not beating it tonight I could
stop the stream at any moment any moment
then constraining z6 it is currently
10:30
technically I started ten to four six
nine five headed before six no it's
right before 10:30
that's a good meaty stream
I don't like that one patch bright by
his butts like a rectangle patch that
you won't get bloody that's so weird
is it down musical goodbye battle song
are you going around like that crazy
woman you're a crazy woman
stop being so crazy crazy woman
let me try
you went to journalism school
what a mess
this just gets better and better Wow
looks like somebody didn't like the show
much you should get this on video
they didn't wants to see what really
went down
don't use guns
I'm not so sure Kyra's not involved but
it definitely proves someone's covering
up what really happened not a badly
kiddo
now it's time to show me those pictures
I'm on my way
wait who was that just a friend
the leader of cure gotta go
so riven 53 this game sucks I'm just
curious how do you feel about the first
one this is the series you don't like
hers at this game
cuz I like one more but I mean two's
alright it's not like terrible or
anything I got blood on my back proper
that's nice
flashlight there's more protective than
I don't remember it they change that Zoo
feel like a jerk Griffin I mean you're
allowed to not like a game there's
nothing wrong with that it's not your
thing it's not your thing
but the fact that his ass would not get
blood on it in a perfect like rectangle
shape was just distracting it was just
horribly distracting I'm sorry I know
that's weird just the room that's
supposed to have the KD backpack
I guess I just missed it for good
nope right
nope nope nope nope nope do
money things at night
come on not big job not a big deal
I'm gonna find out what the security box
is doing it's so weird I don't think
those are in vanilla Dead Rising 2
that's some fun stuff
why did she shoot me I get too close
Oh
so here you chuckling about Dead Rising
3 Sport agonist I haven't I haven't
played Dead Rising 3 what's what's wrong
with the Dead Rising 3 s protagonist I
don't think the people in charge of this
series now I heard one of the camp on
Vancouver or whoever I just don't I
don't think they know what a good
protagonist is they can't they can't
handle that shockingly I don't want to
take a shotgun from you here
oh there might not be the way to go
ships Spitfire we have Spitfire
let's go seems to work differently than
it did last time it doesn't work at all
it's crap they ruin spit fire it doesn't
do jack shit my dreams of beating the
last boss with spit fire are gone
I know Frank looks uglier I did my best
with the mod I did my best
better check it out after I get back
probably not gonna make it in time and
that's what this is not a serious
pleasure
so we're not gonna make of all these
damn zombies are they following me
yep
yeah
guy in a yellow jacket which guy -
yellow jacket nice white a bunch of
shotguns
oh we're dead we're dead and I think I
think our stream is about to come to an
end yeah I hope you've all had fun
tonight I appreciate everybody coming
out it's been fun playing uh not a hero
it's been fun playing Dead Rising 2 off
the record I'm assuming jack will be a
part of any stream that's going on
Sunday so things should be somewhat back
to normal at that point I don't really
have have much to say other than have a
good night
