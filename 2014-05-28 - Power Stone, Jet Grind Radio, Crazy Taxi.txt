the Mac one that's free oh I didn't see

oh that's a great move I want to use
that all the time Oh see that shit I did
I did I mentioned your ass killed ah
it's just really good at power yeah I
love this game we're not big very chatty
we're not being chatty they just heard
you say that at the house
no that's right yeah yeah Jessa keeps
forgetting that there's a microphone
pointed at her face to the side to me
not me you might as well just tell them
not to say that anyway oh yeah I don't
play in that band anymore I haven't for
like seven years but thank you for
liking it you don't have to buy anything
I think you can get all the music for
free don't give any money to those guys
that's all deal
I get sort of that research there no I
have to sorry
oh I guess you didn't get tonight yeah
oh my god Prince Emirates or a member I
got all the damn powers though how did
you do that so far I oughta saan that
good then okay yeah I guess that's true
I'm just gonna crawl away and cry and
cry until you lose your power stone
growling oh no that shit I can't
apparently
ow ow the new loud is how yeah there we
go if that helps anybody anywhere I
don't know oh yeah yeah
oh you beat on me I beat it out of you
oh snap Jesse have you ever seen the
movie Dead Ringers
convert with Jeremy Irons yes wins well
see it the thing is is that's why every
time I see Jeremy Rand see freaks me out
is that yeah
I rewatched it last night a long time
that being so distinct between the two
brothers and their personality their see
that one gave me nightmares for like a
year yeah yeah it was one brother starts
getting addicted to pills and designing
all these weird gynecological
instruments yeah so awesome does nothing
to do is video game no that's good talk
because we're tonight
if there are any questions for us you
believe in someone I am what strength
you want to know the questions that I've
really mastered that is fair and that's
completely appropriate for Albany
playing horse no absolutely not you
playing car so that is reason oh shit I
got the power stones first time that's
the first time I've gotten the power
stones and now I'm not using them
through the triggers are the mega
attacks let's do that then
thank you for telling me that
now I win you know once you do the mega
attack you lose the power shot so
sometimes I think I'll soften them up or
the other tax your last thing oh oh oh
I'm saying that it's buzzing what's
buzzing every time you're buzzing my
last time - no I fixed that no he did I
thought I did did you I did he did it oh
you know what I just changed the mic so
I might need to quick go change the
setting actually I realized that we were
recording audio from the unit my husband
Mike's better right in front of our face
I see so then I change the settings oh
my god I can fly thinking it would give
us better audio but maybe that's making
it buzz Oh jack I'm like you doing the
commercial because I'm terrible at this
game what game is this power stone oh
that's the name was again yeah okay
it's one of the greatest way to get
there look - great I think Sam I think I
might be used to playing Power Stone too
you know because I could hit you with
the hammer because I'm kicking your ass
with a giant hammer ah okay yeah yeah
yeah
hammer wins over rock that's that's Rock
Paper Scissors number one what there's
only three components to rock paper
scissors and him to start including new
things then you're playing it wrong here
marker one row
let me rogue again cuz I like her
boobies oh my god oh my god yeah I said
it new there's nothing you can do about
it guys I said it I mean it this
question just what I got okay
you don't need to explain yourself no I
don't know people are just saying birds
that you see going past you okay jack
isn't it's man it's no you know what I
don't know I won't get into it I guess
or I guess I will I like butts like much
better yeah okay buzz is really loud
though is it yeah we should probably
listen it's industry's ever since you
apparently pitch the mic so why is it
when you fix things you just make it
worse because I wait for Jack well he's
oh god no way he's gonna be distracting
it'll be right in the way that's fine
people gotta watch something well we can
just talk in addition to dead ringers I
watched the film death spa last night
which I've decided needs to be on best
of the worst
yeah because it's amazing it's got a
great cover just came out on blu-ray
it's weird see movies like that like
these shitty disposable 80s movies with
like a nice cleaned up
blu-ray like it looks weird when it
looks that nice yeah it feels in a pro
it actually looks good and you can make
out what's happening yeah and some of
the lighting is nice or it's like wow
there's effort put into this but when
you watch the old shitty VHS copies it
everything just looks so bad yeah I was
only washed with wet on blu-ray oh and
in two three that look good that looks
great
but like it was it looks so good that
you could clearly see like the layer
holding up that just adds to it I shake
it oh yeah something bright upset how
was that yeah my favorite that's the
best that is wonderful
Elizabeth that is wonderful guess that's
no surprise to me you who loves that
you guys are taking a moment to listen
to stream okay um you planted things so
you can hear knock in the mic and then
the headphones so you can find out if
this problem okay I'll keep talking I
need random things Jenna didn't say
about that awful awful episode best of
the worst we just hope oh yeah that
episodes going in the vault
oh yeah sure it's going in the back
maybe when we were all falling asleep
while we're having the discussion it was
about to happen eventually though where
you get an episode was just three total
duds yeah we tried to make it work it's
definitely going it would it would
require some very cream you did a good
job jack way to go hey hey Jack just
cheated Jack finally fixed something and
then he cheated immediately
so evil wins evil wins everybody okay
haze rescue Mowgli watch that made it so
bad but I don't think we should tell
them no we might we might never know but
I have I have been editing another best
of the worst so that'll be coming
eventually yeah somebody did ask if
there is another one coming up soon yeah
so yes there there will be more coming
out eventually it's just that last
specific one we made not the end take
your ass up you are you are already
kicking Maya oh I got a magic thing and
now I lost my thing oh my fuck
okay yeah I was being able before okay
so now you should be able to clearly
hear us and here the game is my hope and
work is the best weapon everything from
hammer hammer go Pete Oh ders going into
the stream is an input from these mics
and an input from the actual audio the
game yeah and you know I think the last
stream all we were doing is picking up
audio from the TV yes I figure that out
hopefully
Oh screw Wang Peng Wang Peng you gotta
be gotta be Roman or Rouge or whatever
her name is
tits McGee what's here what's your slang
rich my slang Jupe Jupe Jupe jab give
Wayne saying the Jupe jab
I'm gonna be going I think oh where you
can do this you know I'll this will be a
fun man I wonder what is the
stereotypical Indian oh you have me do
ya Native American cultural
insensitivity it's true staple of oldest
video games right yeah I guess any pop
culture actually cartoons yeah you know
what you're probably right yeah oh
there's going to be a fight now
okay I'm yellow pants and Rich's pink
pants already fuck fuck fuck fuck
we're just turned into Optimus Prime me
and apparently what did I do where did I
go my god rivero's well there you go
oh good twenty way again I'm yellow
yes I can totally see that happening
thinking yellow was apparently not big
enough distinction no wow hitting
yourself because you didn't know which
one you were I wish there was more moves
that I can do I'm gonna walk in front
good oh yes go dude I got one up fuck

we're gonna try to do our best to talk
and fight barrel barrel roll yes I'm the
greatest power some power some power

asset games I'm super great at this and
Crazy Taxi throw barrel per barrel
Oh table wins barrel guys remember that
whenever you're playing game table wins
barrel

daddy here Captain Jack ah oh shit oh

ah fucking hell shit there we go okay
I'm trying to like I think if we get
another coaster under there to help prop

Wow oh no I'm doing terrible at the game
oh fuck
thank you all right do you feel better
now right I'm back on track you feel
better
okay that's good yes I'm glad you feel
let me quick take a look at the chat
here see if anyone is do anything
anything interesting going on Rome know
what their favorite games they're uh you
know we've been asked like what our
favorite game is and it's that's a tough
one because it's just like favorite game
what that one all the time
exactly so I think the more appropriate
question to ask someone who plays a lot
of games or watches a lot of movies
what are you playing now or what did you
see recently because then that's more
interesting question so I'm going to
take your question completely ignore it
and ask my own question of what I've
been playing recently what have you been
playing recently Jack I'm like we talked
about earlier been playing a lot of a
Stanley parable and that's really fun
I've been playing risk of rain a lot
because that's super funny and once
again I recommend everybody at least
check out the demo for the Stanley
parable absolutely at the very least
it's interesting yes um the other game
that I have been playing I've been
trying to play a lot of is fistful of
frags which is a free western-themed the
first-person shooter I made with the
Source engine and it's really it's
really cool like it's all iron sights
it's western themed which is really fun
so they have some very fun levels
unfortunately its controller support is
a little janky and I have not found much
help in that department all of the
controller buttons work except for
vertical so I can't look up or down with
my character and whenever I go to the
forums to request help people just say
that I don't use a controller and I say
fuck you what is it control oh my god
the fistful Frank's story and my ass got
handed to me fuck you I like a
controller the controller feels nice to
me that's fine we it's okay to have
different opinions
do you know but do you know we don't
know nothing about nothing except for
losing that Power Stone that's what I
know about oh man I am oh hey I'm gonna
die that's fine I just wanted to go on
the phone I I bet I think my character
sucks no I've loved one with him before
oh you went super saiyan on us your head
it did not the moral story Jack I beat
Jax
hi he did is checkout Fistful of Frank's
it's a preview first-person shooter here
it's been fun just full of fries I don't
I don't we might want to take a break
we've been streaming for a while you do
that oh we get multiple people involved
with it let's um our son let's play it
let's play one more game and then we'll
take like a like a 10-minute break and
eat food what's the level we haven't
played before over there we were there
we were there I think we've been there
well do bed the game chose for us
okay Amy we're insane yeah so after this
round we're gonna take like a 10 15
minute break and bring it back so how
many people are gonna run out and buy a
Dreamcast because they weren't for the
power stones event
something breaking this is fun Oh
oh hey look I went super saiyan already
oh I turned into a pretty butterfly oh
fuck yeah oh yeah
you ain't got shit on this little lady
get out of here get out of here get
outta here oh you got no oh uh I thought
I told you to get out of here
Wow don't shoot me with a oh shit you
turn into a thing Oh see that oh my god
you can go up there saying because he
jumps off the bed attack Oh Jeff Jack
Jack wins okay kale my bear I barely
want I just want to point out like one
more tiny sliver of helpers
no one loves jangles like the absolutely
it was like okay you so busy so slow I
can't
yeah I think that's that's a good thing
to blame is your character and I think
that a poor craftsman blames this to us
yeah I watched a lot of Marten growing
up quit and now now we're gonna pause
and take a little break and so I'm just
gonna play that that previously recorded
graphic loop for like ten minutes
so if you guys want to take a little
break - I think that'd be a good idea
we've been streaming for a couple hours
now yeah we started we started right
around 600 so everybody settle you Jimmy
James take a bathroom break you sound
like a like a like one of those
late-night radio is it possible to play
that old Zelda is that is that at all
possible
I don't want well we're not a partner
yet so yeah I when we come back from the
break okay we'll start off okay my

[Part III]

situation but entrants are ahead yeah I
need harsh light this room can people

we skip this cutscene just dip I just
skipped it y'all came out slammed I died
in LA well we have other games Jake
these people don't care what games we
play so there's something else you want
to spit nigga sort of do want to hear us
say stupid bullshit that's it okay in
depth conversations about a game that we
are playing they're like we know you
can't have in-depth insightful
conversations about Eddie that's true
nobody knew deep insightful
conversations and everybody wanted just
bullshit I just had a baby insane you
know
it's a slight buzz and that's what I
don't hey if you want buy us a new
microphone so and and everything you can
do that and then there won't be a bus so
it's all on you they can't listen to
anything right I figured Oh

while this is going on I don't know
what's going on so what is this family
it's a I don't know it's some kind of
rhythm game you have to dance and the
game yeah you have to follow the button

we're figuring this out as we go along
we are professionals we're not
necessarily professional streamers oh my
god you're playing a rose getting game
you never play jettster currently Oh No
any form of this I think I like the
graphics in this that last game looks
stupid pants oh good
I got you exactly oh fuck this I just
want to play the regular game I don't
want to go through a stupid tutorial let
me fuck around skip the tutorial
apparently not okay oh my god do what
she says now God sounds so angry today
is everything okay it's all residual
from that last best of the worst it's
really true it's really true I was in a
foul mood if the past two days another
way we're even though we're saying it
was horrible and uninteresting dick will
want to see it and they never will oh
man maybe it maybe they will it's quite
us now we're given a moment maybe never
but maybe never it'll be one of those
two slightly maybe never but most most
likely almost certainly it's possible
that I will never be also to the people
who are saying that jack is the worst I
absolutely agree with dude I mean but it
is really true that way that was nice
what audio technician okay yeah yeah I
agree with that yeah do you think I'm
the worst audition yeah well maybe not
ever sure yeah I've heard worse yeah so
you know what Jack I disagree with them
for whatever that's worth
oh shit area
seeing people are saying that you're
good in that you're the best yeah well
how can you be the best and the worst
these people need to get their
collective opinions is the best of the
worst
oh my god okay okay
so when was the Dreamcast a thing 99
okay why does the trip cast a thing
technically it's still a thing it's
still a physical object already I'm like
what did think about this competed
against PlayStation right the first
PlayStation with the first place okay
hey and I but I think it was like if I
remember correctly this was like the
awkward this came out slightly before
the ps2 bully with everything out of the
water
okay this rule came out shortly before
the ps2 and was killed large was because
people were anticipating the ps2 didn't
get a Dreamcast because they were
waiting for the ps2 okay what button is
the spray paint they told me to do it I
don't know what was the first system to
because I saw some of these games you
can play you can connect to the internet
what was the first system to make that a
thing where the Internet
wasn't the Dreamcast oh we should do
that we should plug in the internet
browser and see if we can go to any
modern internet site no you know what we
don't have a physical connection doing
we need like a oh sure we need an
Ethernet kid oh yeah we probably need a
phone line this ole I'm not kidding is
it dry yeah looks like a phone line
drink was worth boring we're not
entertaining anyway this Dreamcast was
the I'm learning bio Dreamcast so maybe
our station is where England
okay Jessi give us some material we need
it we need a phone line and a dial-up
modem in order to get on line with the
Dreamcast but if we can make it happen
we will go to red letter media calm and
check out the Space Jam website which
they redid pretty simple online no such
bullshit yeah I know it's worse the fact
that they redid it or the fact that they
felt the need to do anything like if
you're like why don't just get rid of it
all together a promotional website for
Space Jam ah they're still selling the
DVD though so I saw it for four dollars
at Barnes and Noble to get it now that's
too much for it you can turn this up if
you want to hear what's going on I
really need to hear what's going on for
this no just kidding music and whatnot
okay
the sweet Jam oh my god so so is this
like a like a Tony Hawk er like a Tony
Hawk the goal once we get to an actual
level is to spray-paint things sure then
there so this is just like a prelude yes
yeah this is all just really
you gotta collect all the spray paint
cans yeah hey Jay do you ever think about
making a guerrilla interrupted 2 we've
talked about a media agency got any
ideas for guerrilla interrupted sequels
that will never happen
how long were you built the Love Machine
yeah well we talked about all the sudden
the girl interrupts into the commentary
track but we can repeat it here yeah
immediately after well not immediately
but after the first girl interrupted
Lisa leaves you for Mike yeah
and you're upset about this so you end
up building a Love Machine that will
force her to love you but that is taken
over by the Christian group but it's
gonna force everybody to love Jesus yeah
it's an organization that creates like
bible man site videos so we're gonna
have a bible man type character in it
awesome and he was gonna show up at the
end I'd like to try and help save the
day but because he's just a crappy actor
in a dumb costume he just gets killed
immediately it was gonna be a horrific
death using a bear I'm one of those
rubber costumes yeah and the rubber
caster was gonna be like melted into his
flesh that was gonna be his face and the
head of the company it turned out it was
Jesus right yes and then Jesus disguised
it's like a sleazy businessman that was
gonna use the Love Machine to make
everyone love him again world had gotten
so crumbs and then we also had the idea
for the spin-off movie not exactly a
Girl Interrupted sequel but it was going
to be just about SID
Mike's character said there was gonna be
called sit napped it's stuck in like a
crate and ends up in Australia and he
starts boxing kangaroos sort of like
underground Fight Club where he has to
box kangaroos Colin brought a car we're
supposed to grab a car in about how oh
this is terrible I'm terrible and
everything is terrible then why am I so
terrible how do I play this game Nate I
think we need a lot of money we have to
go to Australia to make it and we would
need actual kangaroos sure absolutely
somebody has a good question why would
Jesus need
how many folks it's a comedy because
it's the sequel to gorilla interactive
that's why could we you guys know the
movies called guerrilla interrupted
right I don't know how to pitch right on
the car tell me before the thing I'm
supposed to follow did it and it's not
don't let me went but I press to do that
so no I don't know everything sucks
it says they say in the stream press the
grab there's no grand but it just
doesn't he just does it automatic stream
people there's no crap button oh just
paint cans up here I grab where the air
they are all right I better wear that
they're just floating in the air why
does nobody seemed to notice this
because they're too busy being
conformist oh I am sucking so bad today
oh god that's the thing I got a paint
where's the thing I got a paint somebody
says that you have to press the button
okay you want me to answer that
yeah
transcription
I'm sort of thing
fifteen minutes
zero yeah I know that's an old lady way
of thinking about yeah
what else come on you played this game
oh my god I have no idea what happened
to the audio
why is everyone complaining about the
audio oh yeah I don't know he's a
buzzing again I don't know do we
we literally refreshed nothing folks
hold on did you know
oh so we down there okay I I was sitting
on a couch I didn't fuck up anything
it's very soft box we're two headphones
we go oh oh wait that's not bad oh you
had them West right there oh they want
my Jam's it's fine that it's fixed now
what hey people take a jump kick people
to chat what happened the sound just
looks bloated but it's fine now okay
that's strange we're still working out
the kinks here folks
yeah then we work out the kinks for a
while okay okay now I go back down and I
spray the thing and everybody's happy
and I get hit by a bus and I don't die
does that it ghost bus I could see right
through it ah yeah very trick no look
out for the ghost vehicles Matson Creek
Jackie's bunks reason I am went down the
wrong Street so I don't think Oh God I
like this game at some would touch skip
don't show you how to do it again okay
let's keep the headphones for you in
here okay I guess
that folks yeah okay oh my god maybe we
get hey guys everything everything's
fine everybody let Jay talked about David
Lynch oh I love David lunch Jay stop
talking about David Lynch you're fuckin
up the stream okay no go ahead talk
about technology Oh what do you want me
to say I'm very excited about the Twin
Peaks that that's coming out and the
hour-plus
of deleted material from fire walk with
me I can't wait yeah yeah hey everybody
pekes is mostly an amazing show man in
that second season gets rough though
yeah really does but it picks up again
at the end even when David Lynch comes
back but that's well the last episode
that's yeah and maybe my favorite thing
David Lynch has ever done it's so great
yeah he's so cute - he is so adorable
got that voice yep I love his uh his
character in Twin Peaks - oh yeah the
commanding officer that's hard of
hearing yeah this is constantly yelling
I looked a little bit in fire walk with
me when very early on when there they
have a school bus pulled over and
there's all the kids on the school bus
screen crying and they have like hookers
or something trying to envision what the
scenario is and how it happened how
those two worlds because we never
learned
and I really love Eraserhead sure what
do you think the worst thing blechh has
it done um I like all of his movies
pretty much maybe dumb lambs that cart -
I'm not few ever saw that I could never
get into that I don't why do you ever
see double oh no I haven't it was it was
a online cartoon thing you did I could
not get into it but as far as movies go
my least favorite might be Lost Highway
you know but I still like it a lot but
if you had to play them in order that
would be your and the way they last as
most people would probably say Inland
Empire but that movie is just so insane
that you can't watch it you have to set
your day aside to watch that movie it's
so creamy - 90 % of the movie is
close-ups of Laura's face awkward
unflattering close-ups of words but
listen guys I don't wanna I don't want
to give too much away about the next
episode of the grab mouse keys all I'm
saying is it takes a dark turn
something's something's in the are you
gonna do this - no offense the people
who like the girl the script for a girl
skis feature that we never made then I
didn't want to make it Mike wrote the
scripts oh I didn't really want to make
it I don't even remember something
happened where Santa accidentally got
into like a hot air balloon and flew
away I really don't remember the only
thing I remember that was funny in the
whole script was that at one point cliff
Kapowski punched a guy it so hard that
he flew into outer space
that's the only thing that it should be
yeah that's all it should be because
that was clicker Buffy his power was
that you he punched people right people
are asking about dude bros why do you
throw it was a failed thing that we did
I only recently like last week watch the
dude bros that was my first time
watching a dude bros was last week
oh yeah what did you think of the new
broom now I finally get the eat it with
your mouth Jim oh yeah that's all that
started let's think it was an improv
that's that's funny that's the only one
of those I like was the Oreo cake store
one yeah the other two didn't quite work
somebody asked where fuck pot is stored
in the roof he has his own little
containment unit yeah it's kept at a
certain temperature to preserve
yeah it's humidity control yeah yeah how
old is fuck five miles
Oh God three yes four years is still the
original cardboard box which might be
crumbling no it's still he's fine no we
made those updates to on but yeah every
like whenever we bring fuck on out it
always takes like like three coats of
aluminum foil tape and aluminum foil and
duct tape and we have to change the
batteries and all the blinking lights up
in the space cop no no no probably not
space cups a real movie guys and a man
we can't afford him for it and fuck
bodies I might I might steal fuck BOTS
arms I'd like to start doing the bye
like my five point of view buying that
so I think I might go get fuck BOTS arms
someone's know where your stored rich
lives in a shed behind the studio it's a
really nice shed no yeah oh my god do
you guys hear the Dreamcast chugging is
that what that is I heard that noise
yeah I wasn't sure it was 1999
technology it's an old piece of tech Oh
someone said if they're charging up
Georgia Carrie Fisher for Star Wars then
we can put the fuck button space wow
that's very very harsh for perhaps fuck
BOTS will make a very special cameo so
you have to buy the blu-ray extended
edition of space copy and in the
extended cut you'll be able to see fuck
BOTS okay yeah oh my god why is that guy
shooting it up and I'm trying to rapini
the place so they shoot at you for
graffiti yes oh my god very strict I
guess oh god get away your way don't
know what I'm doing I'm terrible
oh my god
good mate
oh it looks look like I know that's an
exclamation point but it looks like
you're thinking about a hotdog oh my god
even powers oh I suck so bad it is true
that space cop is already getting Oscar
buzz oh yeah can we do the same joke we
did last week sure a space cop is
getting Oscar buzz and that's very nice
of Oscar to talk about her film like
that he's a very nice man it's still
funny by the way okay
still a funny joke I forgot about it I
think it was like an ashamed aside
doo-doo-doo
sorry what do you think about jet
grinding radio oh your graffiti and
final yeah AC happen I am kind of in
control I just sucked not bad so you're
repeating over other people's graffiti
yes there's turf wars on the cops okay
alright because I never answered my
favorite movie question they said that
my favorite movie is Mike I can't speak
for Jessi but I know what people always
ask what's your favorite movie like I
don't know how to answer that yeah I
don't know yeah there's a I mean do you

samurai cop another days its Eraserhead
the person who said that they bought the
space cut poster today I know who you
are because I filled your order oh my
god we know where you live you might
want to see the person who keeps
demanding that Mike come into the stream
he is literally in the next room and
we're not gonna ask him to come in
because he doesn't give a fuck about
videogames
oh man you're actually grinding Radio
jet cranberries oh all right hey this

on rollerskates in this game as I am in
real life oh it's the dirigible

quite a Metal Gear game by I think
they're kind of bullshit oh the
controversial opinion isn't the
conclusion does not equal good I don't
know what that means cuz I'm anything
about the game the plots in those games
are just kind of batshit crazy okay
games for the sake of conversation I was
about to ask everyone how their Memorial
Day was but then I remembered what
everybody did on Memorial Day yeah and
you already s when you came in while we
were watching the movies really came
back the hot dogs we're in the middle of
watching those miserable yeah yeah we
watched terrible movies great Jackman
real day is the day I discovered that my
tolerance for alcohol is much lower than
it used to be yeah you were kind of
crunk you're doing the one half I
clothes thing oh no no maybe
I'm gonna do it guys I'm gonna do it
no not gonna do it a date with rich
Evans costs one hundred and fifty seven
thousand dollars freely just one day
then yeah that's it that's that's
actually kind of a bargain I know you
could charge way more than that rich if
you want a handjob
it's gonna be that's the stream
everybody that's what they'll be saying
at the end of the day funny get outta
here go go go
we how do you do tricks Jesus jumping
does the trick video multiple jumping oh
yeah okay hey that's okay hey guys I
just fixed it everybody cares about the
video I just fixed it or maybe not

it I don't think it's fixed it's totally
fixed it's not amazing it's totally
fixed frozen fix fix
hey you relax if everybody could just
take a moment and settle the fuck down
it looks very though well this game
doesn't have any Jimmy James no no this
game really doesn't have any Jimmy no
we it's because we know what
everything's called it spray painting
yeah it's very glitchy now

okay hold on everybody
fix the stream again this dream that
keeps getting broke fix the dams yeah we
go you know what we're gonna play

stream would have been perfect if only
these guys were better in video game
we're terribly
we're very distracted with each other
and talking to people oh yeah yeah I'm
bursting yeah of course this is a game
we're plating god this since 1999
you plot I'm just surprised you played
it in 1999 when will the worm a
Dreamcast was held sure right I wanna go
stay in one with offers it was fun well
you know this was like the first major
game that had associated yeah yeah I
think that was like a first for this and
that was probably the major reason I
bought it because oh this looks the meat
it does have a very nice art yeah and
yeah I like the style of this oh my god
it's a pretty game it is a pretty game
we play FTL we love that we love FTL
that feels just amazing
yes what does that feel faster than
light start search the game okay it's
you get to be captain of the spaceship
and you have to still looking pretty
good over there
yeah what is it what is it like pregnant
just could be our internet connection
this is our connection is the stream
looking good or straight and it's
Thunder eat you give a shit is the audio
also stuttering this is the question for
everyone it just could be you know we're
sending out the signal and getting the
signal bang you know we're using a lot
of the tubes here which is a totally
real thing Oh team G or Deep Space nine
totally TNG totally ts9 but I just find
stream looks good oh yeah Deep Space
nine is I don't know it's not my go-to
which one had Bakula on it that's okay
any one of those you know there is an
episode where he's on a beach playing
beach volleyball with no shirt I know
that's like the best movie on demo spa
there was a woman in it that looked
really familiar I was like who is this
woman so I looked up on IMDB and it's
got back it was wife in real life she's

first contact with the civilization and
like the car and bikers like this guy's
one of the aliens and he gets into your
face in the hospital and they're all
freaked out because they've discovered
an alien oh that's one da a.m. that's
called that's another excellent episode
yeah it's a great one
you know you know what episode I totally
loved is um oh my god I'm gonna forget
the one where Picard is stuck on the on
the alien planet with the guy who speaks
really funny darn doc oh thanks
the most nonsensical alien race though
but yeah that is a brilliant episode
where they can't fit they can only speak
in metaphors they can only speak in
metaphor and no and that's why no one
can figure out their alien language
there's a third alien language and they
never should have been able to get off
their own planet
yeah but it's a great episode that's a
good classic Star Trek and darm dharma
dharma continue go ahead tonight or
whatever that's alright you just made
these names up I made the second name up
people are saying that yeah start
walking to it to not glitter it's a real
thing yeah okay I don't think ye that
race because well yeah it's the most
nonsensical yes
language at least ever it's a it's a
dumb alien language but it's a great
life
Picard having to figure shit out and not
and be non violent episode jalan-jalan

there's plenty of things to spray we
okay why are we not watching the flat
pocket oh because they're probably
getting loose use the regular use they
are using use they're all using all
those sports people they're just using

large paint can I'll take it

you guys I am pretty much killing it at
jet grind radio I'm not gonna lie what's
the name of the huge jet grind radio
okay Oh puck we released on the Xbox as
Jet Set Radio yeah they changed the name
I don't know why cry nope they thought
the word grind was too aggressive are
you gonna go look up Scott back up the
big banks you guys just ran out of this
room so she's looking Scott back Jessi
turn on private browsing at this stage
is still stupid enough to send dick pics
or like like like the actresses and
stuff it's like yeah it's certainly it's
going to get out it's a given
what are you right up on my mind I try I
try to touch your eyes Jean near the end
of that ramp Jack I tried going thank
you great there's an arrow behind but I
turn turn don't know Wow yep yep
Oh Jet Set Radio was the original title
that was changed for the English release
oh okay
Oh any mark I played a little bit of jet
set radio on the Xbox it seemed like a
rebate to be more secretive so jet set
was a sequel yes it was sequel I know
them a little bit I never heard the
other things I could be wrong
wrong about anything that was a doofy
laughs sorry I have um a dupe everyone
know I'm gonna take this first oh oh oh
oh I thought they were it's a herb stop
in your zone they said oh you got away
you're mad yeah
finish we don't want you to get away we
want to bust you for being dumb
graffiti yeah for a while
pretty much pretty much run if you guys
want a rich Evans laughs you're gonna
have to fucking baby
I can't think that shit I try people do
think it's fake - no it's our others
comments about that hello here you go
Jay what's the best Friday the 13th
movieo4 Jay oh that's actually a tough one
because I like a lot of them for very
different reasons as far as the best
like actual movie horror movie probably
Park for most entertaining is probably
part six trend was for was that sores
the one with Corey Feldman okay
reshape the set at the end to confuse
Jason that one's actually pretty good
movie it's got weird stupid stuff in it
but for a Friday the 13th movie it's the
best put together it's got the best
what was three things like what three
was the one with Corey Feldman Oh three
was 3d 313 I was yeah I was the one when
they're in the farmhouse
I guess sir the farmhouse in a lot this
one was only done three D gimmicks
that's the one REE Jason gets his mask
and part 4 has the the Crispin Glover
dance which may be for no other reason
that's why it's the best and I just
remember your birthday you watch them
all was so great it was a marathon is a
birthday I'm hurt a hug yeah but not
just not just watch them all watch them
all on the set I'm the point consent no
I guess it wasn't like it said but it
was the dock of the dead house set which
was covered on fake blood at that point
yeah so the windows were boarded up so
basically what we watch them out on for
a movie set yeah yeah oh it was utterly
rain it was 90 the 13th movies on Friday
the 13th all day you have to tell people
be careful don't slip on fake one oh my
god no no birthday and for the rest of
my life will ever top that yeah well and
it was especially creepy because you
know like it was a living room set yeah
and then when I got I forgot you were
other son you wouldn't forget her on a
second or a while and then just look up
and there's no ceiling it's very weird
it was really unsettling but I think I'm
I have to tag this guy but I already
tagged him once somebody is overjoyed
that I have this promise to work Oh
looking good
do you made someone's day hey can I
oh is this the thing I need to do well
people are other people are running
bye-bye
thanks for coming how many people are
watching right now just explore about 17
people who the last minute yeah
you know why too much shit that right
here yeah oh I have no idea where I'm
going on what I should be doing also not
like that's different than any other
time but every Sun you got a knock that
guy down okay how do I knock him down I
don't recall
I guess you jump on his back I don't
know okay try charge economics bags what
happens okay I'll find them okay
how are we not going sky down
tell me three seconds ago Oh every
people are saying that everyone is
leaving here to go and look at Scott
Bakula see I claim you know that's
really understandable no you didn't
bring up the dick pic you didn't even
know I didn't even know somebody here
told me oh she made it seem really
appealing though I'm sorry well really
how do you make Scott Bakula dick pic
not sound appealing right okay okay all
right that's okay
we want something else well I mean I can
keep playing this is really fun or
unless you wanna play Jay do you want to
give did say you want to give another
game a shot I don't really want to give
this game a shot okay well then I think
let's take another break juice up and
come back for some four player Power
Stone - what controllers you know what
we'll see if we can drag Mike in here
everybody takes a break we're gonna see

press the X button to throw it okay X is
useful I may not be as useful for

story but that's all we got now we're
chocked full of disappointment.
Jay: Ever plan on, I think we answered this last week, ever plan on doing a live Best of the Worst. No. There's a reason that editing exists, and editing is what makes those, those episodes.
