[Part I]
no they don't notice anything you don't
think they've noticed they've never
noticed anything different ever like
like the the last couple streams we
didn't have a face cam yeah nobody
notice the thing that's I know I know
they're not a very um they're not very
bright
well I was observant they're not very
observant yeah yeah well it's kind of
the same thing is that very bright
no you know I think there's a there's a
brightness oh look how high up that is
we have a primary complaint that Ridge
had about the face cam was you know we
would talk to you guys but have to look
at the chat and so we moved the camera
real quick though well I'm looking at
the screen krieger 7 8 3 14 months in a
row and telegin 15 months in a row you'd
be Krieger 7 8 3 buy buy buy one month
one month congratulations thank you for
subscribing we really appreciate it
it's true we really do alright hearings
working on this oh my god we had 18 more

kool-aid man 13 months in a row and
press B to dick punch thank you for
subscribing we really appreciate it it's
true we really do mm-hmm
anybody else who shows up after that
well tough shit you're gonna wait all
right we're streaming we're going oh my
god we got games shit game we got the
cam and the the thing that was taking us
a little longer to to get down is if
you're watching this online it's
something we talked about a little bit
ago we now have a tip jar and we have no
idea if it works but under under the
screen there's a little link to to
stream tip dot-com if you tip something
may happen if you test something may
happen something may happen we
to set a tip limit and so we set the tip
limit it'll only show up on screen if
you tip over $2,000 yes right
so $2,000 that's that's the mark you
want something amazing to happen yeah
and that's it if you want to if not no
big deal that's how it works
turn on the game turn on the game so
rich I already had problems with my
title of the stream yeah ink blot test
and like you know I just tried to come
up with a with a quick thing so
invisible ink blot test it looks like a
bird because the you know they kind of
have wings
I've never do when you see in blood
tests I've always see birds no I don't
always see I usually they look like
vaginas then all seriousness I've never
done I don't care to me yeah they almost
all look like a pelvis you just got a
squiggly thing in each side it's kind of
like a big 8 shape like a pelvic bone
pelvic bone okay public bone like an ax
skeleton okay okay I think that's fine
I've never actually thought about an
inkblot test more than like seeing them
on TV shows and whatnot if that's a
normal thing I'm gonna turn our volume
get to the main cinema
like the Dodger and get out no detours
proceeding to target so we're playing
invisible ink because there is a new dlc
new characters items that's great well
see how it all works up so the big news
in our life
yes is I have now seen a Neal Breen film

brain

yeah we were neil breeding yeah we're
breeding we were we were breeding we
were bringing about Neal and and Ed
McMillan wanted to do a screening of was
a double no nor the other one one of
them one of them and he tweeted at Neil
Neil Breen asking you know for
permission to do it oh yeah and what do
you say oh and and breehn breehn was
like absolutely not like legal legal
reasons we can absolutely cannot cannot
screen my movie and it's it's it's like
he responded to it on his Twitter but he
it wasn't like a personal response it's
just like on his Twitter please don't
screen Oh Neil Breen doesn't know how to
use Twitter follow him on Twitter
because instead of replying to people he
just tweets out to all of his followers
the answers to random questions if you
follow him on Twitter you'll just see
him say like no maybe next week it's a
nobody and you can't find the question
that anyone asked him he's a beautiful
beautiful Neil Breen is a beautiful man
thank you tell me though the head of a
grill and he kept badgering he did bring
about I don't know if this is a story we
can share no I don't know okay I'm
unsure so I don't I don't want to I
don't want to say the end of his story
all right that's fair enough but the
point is you should kneel Breen is
beautiful and and we finally saw we saw
double down and I'm really excited about
that you should all watch I don't
believe that Breen can use five laptops
at once I know on kool-aid man well we
we think none of them might be on but I
think I think Neil Breen is so good mmm
he does not need to see what's on the
screen and he has his screams and
disabled so that nobody
see what he's doing on the computer yeah
created a monster we've created a bit of
a monster okay I love it and I'm saying
the things you guys are typing in the
notes aren't showing up oh my god oh I
wanted I want the notes well I'll figure
that out I'll fix this cuz like the
notes I want I want you guys to be able
to see the notes that you type that's
part of the fun yeah right now yeah all
they're seeing is they're just saying
the name in the amount oh okay well we
gotta fix that we gotta fix that looking
at while I'm doing this I do well first
we should thank the people yeah
leftover beefcake thank you for the five
dollars the five dollars that leftover
beefcake is giving us is to invest in
acetone to dunk these steam controllers
into I don't well here's I want to I
want to make this clear yeah I don't
hate the steam controller I just think
if you already own a controller yeah and
or a keyboard mouse it's just not really
worth it right it doesn't do anything
better if I mean like I can only speak
from a perspective of the way a mouse
and keyboard user yeah it's definitely
not enough of a step up in shooters to
be worth it I'm just gonna keep using my
mouse and keyboard on the couch look at
this you got your boy yeah my board and
a mouse I'm on the couch and it's
working fine this is working just fine I
can do this so I can buy a steam
controller that's like it's like a buck

Lucky Strikes I can't take off my shirt

incredibly sexy body great well I'm glad
yeah so much louder than the what the
follow my god that is incredibly louder
than the motherfucker now we need to go

turn off the camera and take off my
clothes or I could go like by the TV and
take off my clothes so rich Canadian I
used to stream without pants all the
time yeah every time as long as it's not
on camera it's fine you can do it
everyone favorite customer thank you
thank you for the 666 hack fraud or bust
you should be able to lean still why
aren't you bleeding we appreciate that
thank you a favorite customer execute
auto six six six need the important
thing here Neil bring me bream he made
me think of like like Chuck Norris
because Neil brain the man is he's a
badass
he's the mimetic badass you know and
Neil Breen can do everything not
anything he can do everything and he
does it better than
anybody else and that maybe you think
it's Chuck Norris well like for the
onion yeah you go ahead and fill in the
details for the uninitiated we've only
seen one Neil Breen movie but I do hear
that this permeates throughout all neo
breaking hey we're gaining tips but
we're losing and like I need to we need
to tweak the settings because like
people are showing up when they like I'm
just gonna use the real one people are
people are giving us like 60 cents oh
really
only alert for two dollars I should've
but it's not but it's not alright so
yeah well that's gotta change we're
gonna obviously this is our first run
with it so new key hunter says that they
would like Jack to eventually play
Arkham City I love the game and I think
he would - I am I am going to do that
I'm actually I think I'm pretty close to
asylum to beating asylum I still pick it
up every once in a while obviously we
have to play other stuff for the show
yeah but I'm actually pretty I've gotten
a lot farther in Arkham Asylum and so I
do plan on playing cities you haven't
playing so yes yes it's fun its own it's
you know the combat oh man that combat
is just great that combats the best but
by Chuck Norris Chuck Norris was the
thing Niro so so for the for the
uninitiated Neal Breen in his movies is
perfect he's a fighter pilot he's the
he's the best at everything he's a
computer hacker he's the best computer
hacker the government can't touch him
because he's a ninja he can create a
force field he knows how to he knows how
to do every I don't I don't want to
spoil too much but he can literally do
everything and he's the best at
everything
ever and and the Chuck Norris jokes I'm
sure everybody knows about this because
you know there's a lot of Chuck Norris
jokes where Chuck Norris is the
strongest man in the world oh yeah Chuck
Norris was between a rock and a hard
place and Chuck Norris won and Chuck
Norris were worn right yeah yeah you
know Chuck Norris got put on Santa's
naughty list now he runs the North Pole
yeah yeah Norris jokes yeah yeah but it
made me wonder because Chuck Norris he's
he's not a young man hmm
he's gonna die at some point and I'm
wondering are there people who already
have their Chuck Norris is dead Chuck
Norris I mean jokes written and saved
and they're waiting for Chuck Norris to
die and there's gonna be the post leg it
rained on Chuck Norris birthday he had
to go punch God is that going to happen
are they are these jokes already written
in anticipation of the man's death
here's the answer to that yeah
absolutely anyone who has ever taken the
time to write down a Chuck Norris joke
already has one of the works for when
he's dead like there's a thing on
Twitter where you can like save your
tweets as drafts yeah I am guessing more
than a hundred people have their Chuck
Norrises dead joke just like a click

you know that's fine okay where were we
Chuck Norris jokes which we kind of just
finished but I want to write your own
shut Norris is dead jokes
see that's the anticipation I may be I
think we should do that
so people are writing
noise drugs jack notices dudes thank you
because I like the way you move
no thank you if you're a dude I noticed
you and if you're a chick I know to see
too so maybe we should write some Chuck
Norris jokes yeah in case of his death
but I think we need to be specific
okay like for example what if what if he
dies of a heart attack we need to think
of a joke in which Chuck Norris is so
strong or fast or something in case he
dies of a heart attack so you wonder
these one at a time let's workshop this
workshop Chuck okay some Chuck Norris
death jokes because that's wholly
appropriate Chuck Chuck Norrises heart
was afraid of him and could only escape
through death Chuck Norris is so strong
he actually had a heart attack five
years ago and was holding his heart
hostage something like that that's a
Chuck Norris joke he only died because
he it couldn't make the ransom Chuck
Chuck Norris died of a heart attack only
because his heart got into a fight with
his lungs or something like that
there's something in there it was him
who attacked the heart oh my god indeed
I'm not reading I'm not reading any of
them if they're under $2.00 they're
gonna show up but I'm just not gonna
read any of them

against new coke then people demanding
that they bring back the old coke
where's coke I want the old coke and but
what coca-cola did was they brought back
old coke and in the negative publicity
they had so much negative publicity that
it sold more than ever we're back on top

fairly reasonable who think the whole
thing was just a a stunt a publicity

don't want you to think that I'm forcing
my opinions on you that was a good
Yiddish yeah why don't over this and I

Carlisle that that's fine I'm sure I'm
just well oh I forgot what he says now

what happened to you just hold it over
what's up there fuck you fuck you and
fuck you okay so what is it here mapping
human neural tissue is not a simple task
especially with the ever changing data
of a live subject however is much easier
to get a good day at pull when the
pattern remains constant and still
cannot by skill upgrades sounds bad
scanned ko'd guards generate a random
bonus Oh dead unit scanned will give
permanent skill upgrades oh so if you
kill someone so there's incentive for
killing people apparently for him for

about it you know everyone likes to oh
she's silent when she sprints oh nice
she's not making any noise um no I think
everyone has close enough that made
noise everyone thinks too hardly about
inception if you think about it as like
just a sci-fi action movie it's fun it
has some big ideas and and some neat
action sequences it's just try not to
think too hard about it because the kids
complicated oh that's right winners
losers do their best winners go home and
fuck the prom queen The Rock The Rock
was the best movie was it what is he
saying the untouchables they bring all
something you bring up never never bring
a knife to a gun no no that's Crocodile
Dundee no fucking outline untundi is oh
yeah you're right never bring a knife to
a gun okay yeah they hit you back you
hit them harder something like that
something like that oh my god krob Becky

like one of those etc etc thank you krob
krob krob krob but so I liked inception

the dark knight rises oh I need this for
the guy the guy with the the trait that
lets them gain skills from murdering

Chuck Norris dying and Chuck Norris
jokes no we've gone we've gone the
mundane Rob with Chuck Norris deaths
yeah what happens what what is the joke
if Chuck Norris dies by being impaled by
a narwhal impaled by a narwhal those are
the whales with the unicorn horn is
because the only reason Chuck Norris
died by a narwhal is because he finally
felt guilty for killing the last unicorn
rich which isn't a good mood tonight a
good place tonight
yeah I've been exposed to the wonder of
of breehn the wonder and majesty of the
all-knowing I've opened my heart to our
Savior who is the best at everything
it's so true you know what I am a little
bad at Rockley right now there you go in

worst thing I've ever seen
what
nice one rich thank you thank you you
know that was super subtle I I thought
of that one last night I was waiting for

leftover beefcake wants to make sure we

we can that's the night but yes of
course we will play please mr. and
Yutaka the Cinnabons voice all night if
that's what you would if that's what the
B the Breen were requires then that's
what will be done good kid kid kid kid
kid we do only what no the dagger
what was that that was the dagger oh my
god bond stopped me at the wrong way
still no game audio guys what well I
can't fix it right at this very moment
it's weird and I'm sorry that we don't
have any game audio many apologies well
something be destroyed in the next best
of the worst I'm not at liberty to
divulge such information
I don't need an always destroy something
I don't even know what destroying is I
want to find out you'll have to watch
the show I don't understand what the
meet what the word destroying means you
destroy this I have no idea what it
means
all right there you go I switch off yeah
damn murder what I'm used to playing
matches on the online with us oh sure oh
wait wait I got it wait here oh my god
okay well we gotta wait for Joe to get
ready Joe the Breen is not happy the
Breen will strike you down in your next
life or this one he'll do it Dwight you
know he'll double down he'll strike you
down in this life and in your next one
rich thank you nice one rich on fire
riches the bomb
I'd join late because I forgotten how to
play normal matches right
you got brained right would Breen beat
Chuck Norris up here's the thing Breen
could beat Chuck Norris up 100% Breen
wouldn't do that though because beyond
being like a super strong guy he's also
like a good guy he's got a good heart
but he's also a terrorist but I mean if
he needs to be
he's whatever he needs to be because he
can do everything and anything he could
be Chuck Norris update he wouldn't
because he gives charity that's right
and Chuck Norris his ability compared to
Neal's brain is a charity case so what
would happen is Chuck Norris would come
for a fight and Nia brain would give him
a can of soup that's what you do with
charity give me some soup brain can do
anything that's true what would happen
getting what's the what's the Chuck
Norris joke if Chuck Norris dies in a
bungee-jumping accident yeah look at
that look at that just easy-peasy
he decides that at 83 years old he's in
such great shape that he wants to go
bungee jumping for the first time okay
what what is the is Chuck Norris didn't
die bungee jumping he died because he
was so powerful that the earth bounced
up and hit him he pulled the earth up to
hit him yeah
Krieger V with the jokes these are the
these were trunk we have a bit and we
are sticking with the bitch he's not
happy with three girls not happy he's
done with the baby he's done with the
bit he's done with a bit apparently it's
led to nothing interesting is that
apparently he's done with a bit these
things you guys called jokes yeah you
know what they're minor there's bits
don't always work we're in a good mood
we're trying you assholes oh that's
right Lando was taken Lando was taken is
very correct we still need a Mario
Sunshine Stream yeah yeah fucking love
Super Mario Sunshine so yes absolutely
abso-fucking-lutely Lando is taken thank
you for the tip thanks T Carlisle says I
bet Chuck Norris is just going to die in
line at the DMV ironically the most
boring death ever okay so what's the
joke if Chuck Norris dies while wait or
waiting to renew his license at the DMV
something about getting his number
called
they had to work not to score there
bad you're being you're being bad Chuck
Norris oh my god oh my god oh fuck Jesus
chaos this is chaos whoo Chuck Norris
called their number you know reverse it
that's a standard procedure standard
procedure
I don't I don't think this joke is
leading to much creativity no no that
led to much none you know yeah all right
fine I tried it was jungle it was my
idea
this and you haven't brought anything
you haven't brought it I I thought I
thought our clever creative viewers
would come up with rules of things on
their own and in just now this hasn't
happened the oh the Jo oh that's nice
baby bass bait the joke is starting to
Chuck Boris
that's fine we will give up on our Chuck
Norris death joke bids
yeah Matt be for 25 we didn't talk about
Matt Landis max landis we liked him he's
a cool guy he's a cool guy and we talked
about a lot of cool stuff and he let us
read his comic book like three weeks
earlier than we should have and that was
really neat and he was giddy to have
somebody read it ya know and like not
only that we just talked about comics
and like he's a genuine he like you know
III know like I know how he comes across
but he is a very genuine guy he just
happens to talk a lot and I think people
confuse like the amount of things I
think people know knows he has a famous
father and they just assume he's going
to be a spoiled brat
yeah but he's like really genuine about
things you see that but safe that was a
great boat save you save so much but
he's really genuine about the things
that he cares about and you know it was
really fun talking with him he talks a
lot but it was really fun talking with
him once you figure out how to how to
get him to stop talking it was great
which is of course more a joke but once
you figure out how to get in a
conversation with him he was really fun
to talk to
uh-huh I am I'm looking forward to
Jessica Jones on Friday
oh is that Friday Friday I'm looking
forward to it I'm I'm fan of the alias
comic books yeah yeah yeah um also
everyone please remember if you've
played a couple games with us to drop
out and let other people join I I got
into a preacher debate with max landis
and I had to leave because I haven't
read preacher yet it ended with him
acknowledging that I was right I will
say that boom well that's like like
that's the kind of that's what I mean by
like genuine like he will have nerd
debates but like be totally cool with
your ideas on the subject he presented
his head his idea and then I'm like well
my counterpoint uh-huh and then he
stopped and you could see him thinking
for a second and he said are you right
so no he was he was cool he was cool to
hang with and I I don't want to bother
getting in the details he had a theory
about Jesse's imaginary friend John
Wayne okay don't get into details I
still want to read preacher yeah I
should have buck bounced I could I could
have done it backwards but bounce but oh
my god oh my god I am apparently
terrible at this game right now here we
go here we go almost yeah almost
oh okay Isis I get thisis I'll take this
or or nice shot zum listen thanks zombie
but I'm in this for me okay rich are you
excited all about the preacher TV no it
looks like they're entirely missing the
point I'm at this point half convinced
that the show is gonna have a pro
religion message at the end
from the very little I know about the
comics the the trailer doesn't seem
close to that what but III know very
very little about the comics all right
no he's gonna stick around in that
stupid tone and he's gonna help the
locals with their problems with his
powers it's gonna be so it's gonna be
that bad
I'm worried think yep and they're gonna
be too terrified to have a message a
message of the show being that God's an
asshole they're gonna they're gonna
they're gonna cop out on that oh yeah
they probably have to it's tough because
like AMC has had big success with The
Walking Dead and I want to say a lot of
their success has come from like being
faithful to the comics being a little I
know it's not gonna happen it's not
gonna happen
oh no but this what I'm what I'm
confused with is like they've had
success being edgy and like Wyatt why
are they straying from the formula just
because it saves them a buck do I do I
think our space will be in the show it
doesn't matter because I think they're
gonna get everything important wrong
doesn't matter if that one character is
also in it or not somatically it's it's
it's gonna be contrary to the source
material just wait for it oh my god it's
gonna be like Smallville oh I hope not
who the fuck was that kid that was 90
percent of a trailer fuck that kid fuck
that kid right he's the local that he's
helping I guess
goli gotta be a goalie yo I'll just stay
over here I'll do flips and shit oh shit
why oh because you're your head well you
know it's good to have a goalie
especially like four on four there's a
way to there's a smart way to play
defense and I don't think it's by
hanging back in the goal all the time
yeah you know I think I think like once
the balls on the far end like it is now
I think you're okay hanging out at a
halfway mark
ready to jump in to get an easy goal if
need be I'm with you like I've played TV
too and when one person sits in goal and
you just can't score because there's
assholes is always in your own goal and
it's one you know B versus two other
guys right never gonna score I hardly
ever won me verse two other guys and
he's just sitting back there doing jack
shit for four minutes and I lose that
match because of that you fucked that
person that's not how you play the game
well we have fliers we got Flyers
everybody I got this I got a I'm so oh
my god I'm so sorry
Zomba you you probably had that you
probably had that and I hit you
I knocked yeah I'm gonna I'm going back
to the goal I'm gonna I'm gonna hang out
back here this is where I belong
I can't do anything else right so I'm
just gonna hang out over here if you

what's called cyber seduction that
sounds like the title of the next Neal
Breen movie is that the title of the
next movie there's some kind of movie
about somebody's life I don't know
well cyber seduction the story of bream
the story of one man's conquest of
lawsuit oh I got the assist nice from
all the way back here Mike said
something about Double Down during the
screening and it's like ex-cop
yes he's so right yes well it's it's a
joke if you don't know what axe cop is
ex cop is a webcomic and I literally
written by a five year old boy
where is he seven yeah yeah kid he's
he's definitely young a child drawn by
his older much older brother and it's
about a cop who has an axe and you know
it's it's like and then the cop finds a
dinosaur and he found a dinosaur but the
criminal also had a dinosaur yeah and
they're super sick dinosaur fight and
that's what that's what Neil Breen is
he's a child making a movie cuz he's the
best at everything
axe cop cartoon were already cancelled
oh well I guess I haven't I didn't watch
it till I say this mother comic I read a
little bit got old quick yeah I would
not old quick I would see them if you
want if you want kind of random chaos
and a fun webcomic mmm read dr. McNinja
which is actually it's in its last
storyline
they're making ninja it's getting ready
to end tonight go read it now go read it
now dr. McNinja is amazing
cyber seduction is an anti pornography
movie now we're talking anti-pornography
anti yeah anti a movie that is against
pornography what it wasn't that you were
watching earlier I saw you pop into the
chat and like someone made is are there
people that believe that we live flat
earth yes this is a real face is a real
thing
you know why why because in the Bible in
the biblical view the world is flat it's
it stems from religion that's like
they're they're the same kind of people
who are like the new earth creation at
young earth creationist oh yeah the
people who believe that the earth is
like yeah seven thousand yeah or
whatever yeah some of the more extreme
versions of these people also believe
that the earth is flat really yes
that's amazing I started to watch a
little bit of it and then as soon as as
soon as this part this sort of rich
shared this video that was a YouTube
video about like the science behind Flat
Earth theory
please use air quotes
well there's science there it's bad
science but they're seconds and as soon
as he started like his the main argument
of the piece was a government conspiracy
to keep this information from the public
for some reason for gain because that I
don't know because they don't like God
yeah because somehow that gives them
power and it was and I had to stop
watching there because that that hit the
point of of ridiculous for me but it was
great
that's right can someone show me a non
doctored picture of a satellite that
isn't obviously fake no I I it boggles
my mind that people like that can't
exist oh you weren't here was something
that it was slightly maybe as crazy may
be crazier I'm not really sure flat
earth man all right you don't Neal Adams
Comics comic book legend Neal Adams you
know what he believes
well what who is he firstly he is famous
for drawing like Batman in the 70s okay
really nice art style famous guy famous
comic famous Neal Isaac chemical are
believes in the expanding Earth theory
the expanding yeah the continents fit
together because the earth was smaller
and there were no oceans some point and
it's the earth has slowly been getting
larger you know what I'm gonna say that
makes more sense than flattery I'm not
young I'm just not sure I would take
that over Flat Earth but Neil Neil Adams
is an expanding earth ER okay okay
that's fine that you know now I've heard
it's the comic book Neil or there's this
possibility maybe it's just some other
Neil Adams and there's confusion but
everything I've read it's it's the Neil
Adams so well every time we get hit by a
meteor the earth gets a little bit
larger kid away I don't know this flat
earther video that I saw the guy did not
seem to be joking no no he seemed very
it's a Bible thing very serious cause
like you get like like an hour and a
half into it he's like okay I'm just
being subtle about this but God just
because God and God is oh my god
it's
thank you for subscribing nine says Jack
I believe that the earth is flat more
than I believe that there is a God
lensless in ski can you please
differentiate between religious people
and crazy people look the crazy people
are crazy about their religion this is
an important factor and they're crazy
not that all religious people are crazy
I've never I've never said that and
don't pretend I did well you know it's
you know there there's a there's a weird
line there's a weird line obviously
religion has a tone in this person's
belief that there the earth is actually
flat and this person is a crazy person
and his religion is part of that that
that was you know what that was that was
a whole lot of me saying nothing yeah
and I really liked that I'm pretty good
at that sometimes crazy people there's
crazy people out there this Flat Earth
theory is crazy it's ridiculous it's
beautiful I love it that that can exist
mhm
doesn't that make you feel happy because
it's fun to watch the crazy people be
crazy
I think 9/11 truthers are crazy too and
that has nothing to do with religion but
in the case of this Flat Earth thing it
it does I'm sorry
right yeah they're crazy too everybody
said everybody's a little crazy
everybody's a little crazy man but jet
fuel can't melt steel beams
9/11 truthers our assholes though yeah
you know this flat earth guy sounded
like an asshole you haven't asked so I'm
gonna put that out there somebody still
has the link from what I posted earlier
you can repost it nobody who can see for
themselves oh man it's like if you want
to watch something and just feel good
about you not being crazy I'm having a
terrible night really terrible that
happened really really terrible I can
only imagine like Manos mannose fate han
says for an actual scientist it makes me
want to pull my hair out individually I
can only imagine like someone who like
does really like you know like a
geologist or you know like a NASA earth
scientist you know but but earth
pictures are all fake that have to be
because if you went up that high you'd
hit the dome they blues and all they
believe in a dome there's a dome they
believe in a dome the earth is is 32
miles wide and it revolves in like a
circle over the earth a thousand a
thousand miles above us it was great
maybe they got specific 32 miles wide it
was great so like you get to watch the
video and then if you if you say to
yourself this video is crazy you just
get to feel really good about you not
being that person and it's great it's
like an ego boost it's like a great ego
boost there's there's I think it might
be a different flattering video but
there's one where like he's just like
every time he talks about like gravity
he's just sounds like there's just
discussed is your gravity yeah we got we
all head towards the center huh what
holds the Penguins up gravity
land fly Kaczynski we don't we we don't
mean to insult you and now hopefully no
one in the you calling it Lynn flack is
Lynn fly Kaczynski yeah it's a flat
earther I'm calling it don't you don't
you do it don't you do it
we what my fiancee goes to church I
don't hate all religious people I don't
think they're all stupid no and we and
we do not encourage anyone in the chat
to make fun of religion we do encourage
you to make fun of flat-earthers but
when somebody thinks the earth is flat
I'm gonna make fun of them yes
absolutely
leave the Len fly Kaczynski alone unless
she's a flat earth plant if you're a
flat earther man we can't help you
there's no help for you not even our
Lord breezes couldn't could it could
help you that's the one thing that our
Lord breezes cannot do is defend flat
earthers no no Neil Breen would prove
the earth was flat and then he would
make it round but my fiancée is a
breezes you take the syringe you just
like inject it into the ground
oh you you give nd take breeze
what
what's gonna time as a time as a cube
that makes perfect sense
what oh that's another theory I think
this one was more ingest because
technically it works but you can't prove
it the right what I I'm not familiar
enough with the two to get in depth but
okay the earth could be a cube and the
things we see in the sky and the
day/night cycles would still make sense
oh geez I'm with you I love it I love it
all I think I think it's more thought
experiment than belief on that
whoo I don't want perfectly normal it's
be anawalt ah breathe man
do you see that Neil brain is playing
with us today
Oh Sabrina here someone came to name to
me Oh brain that's that's fantastic oh I
see it that's great
is that why blue is winning that's funny
because Neil brain is the best rocket
League driver he was captain of the
rocket League team you just ended there
he is the best rocket League driver
that's all you need to say I'd like
Allegan when he wins he wins all the
games after after winning after winning
all the medals it awarded to the
greatest of the rocket League drivers
like a I gave up being a rocket the best
rocket leaf driver because of the love
of my life and now when I rock it the
best my love is with me rocketing first
touch
no Neil look at that Neal Brennan was so
good he wanted to score on it on us just
to make it fair just make it a fail kid
just to make it a fail fight what are
you guys talking about Ra's al Ghul is
it raza ratio rule you you were not
faithful enough and the brain had to
strike the it was punishment for your
fear transgression and and because the
Bree the Breen is the best at anything
no one could score on the brain so he
scored on himself yes yes that makes
perfect sense that makes perfect sense
Breen in in the 3rd minute of the game
he will rise to score again I accept
I accept your your just punishment yep
yep
kind of got all flappity do over here
it's Rach
is it rasa ratio cool it's you know what
it's been said different ways they I
think here's the way it works the actual
like way it's pronounced is raysh okay
but I believe the guy who created the
character are forgetting who was it one
of the famous Batman writers and I can't
remember which one it was huh
Danny O'Neill I think okay I think
according to him the way he said it was
Ross oh okay so it's in flux yeah it's
in flux gotcha gotcha I don't know I I'm
half paying attention to the chat so I
don't know where that came from but no
see bill hecka Breen when flack is in
ski you don't need Redemption in my eyes
we're fine we're all good we're having
fun tonight
we're we're having fun we're having
we're cool you can you can I know that
you it's great that you love Mad Max but
it's fine doesn't matter it's fine
everything's great about you all the
time except for if you're flat earther
Billa hecka says Billa hecka says
something that is incorrect and we need
to we need to address this he says he
says Breen is everywhere and nowhere and
that is not true Breen is every way he's
just everywhere he is everywhere all the
time he's everywhere he needs to be
because he is so good at everything that
he is everywhere he wants to be like
have you seen DoubleDown he's alive but
he was also talking to his dead parents
he's both alive and dead this is how he
talks to his dead wife am I wrong
I know I know the Breen fills my brain
with goodness and wholesome it's the
holy duality
oh it's no
holy singularity the holy singularity
the brain is a singular being of pure I
think we're gonna have to disagree on
the text here because he's clearly alive
and dead
no he's also he is also a terrorist and
an anti-terrorist fighter but they're
all one breathe he is both he both saves
and destroys Las Vegas at the same time
that's true there is clearly it breen
duology but it's all for the purpose of
breehn and so it's the singular it's the
singular brain there's gonna be a schism
in the church now it's only but it's
church for four hours and there's
already a goddamn schism I I am an
evangelical brainís are you gonna nail
the the treatise on the door of the
studio
III believe in taking over fuck oh my
god oh my god that was awful of me I
believe taking the word of breehn
literal oh I yes and obviously here's
here's the real part of rich and I
debating the text of brain is neither of
us have read the full text which is
perfect i I've seen I've seen the
trailer for the second book of brain and
and it looks fantastic I am here now
where I am that's the first book of
brain isn't it no double Don is the
first that's the first okay and then the
second is I am here now the third is
fateful findings and the fourth upcoming
book shot by Neal Breen what is the
fourth book of brain it's not it's not
out yet right the fourth book of brain
is in production is in production
latter-day Breen's

those of you who are flat Oh position
properly that's too far ahead through
pass through the upcoming fourth text of
Breen pass through ver pass through what
pester over pass over try to do more of
a thing no it's not don't do it don't do
