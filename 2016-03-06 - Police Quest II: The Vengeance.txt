[Part I]
oh I know nothing oh you're personally
you're partially green screened what are
you doing we started the stream for this
ship yeah you mean you said you were
ready to go you said you were ready to
go yes I'm not tell me to stop no okay
change one thing here so I got such a
tea better DOSBox is doing weird things
to my dual monitor here yes don't forget
actually hop out of DOSBox for a second
and make sure that the OBS volume is
down I didn't and the game what do you
want to do to the game blame
that's pretty dumb okay double-check the
mixer I didn't set that before we went
but I'll double-check it that's great I
see you rich my mic is super low how's
my mic that low it'll be fine it'll be
fine there we go I fixed it I fix it
everybody it's okay everything's okay
okay
I fixed it thank you chat for telling me
my mic was super low cuz it was it was
it was it was high
welcome everybody to destroy everybody
stream the streaming of the streams
everybody streaming all the all the
streams all the time everywhere I
everything's fine is it no thank you for
falling over and I hate it I hate it I'm
sorry I am genuinely sorry that sounds
great I just need you to find this guy's
picture in the manual so we could start
the stream that's all that's all I need
I found it in the manual but there's no
um I couldn't find the name I have the
manual right here but there's all these
pictures but no name no names standing
the pictures so I found his picture his
picture is right there
and there's no name to it zero say you
feel me what does one do hold on I got
assumed that maybe they blocked it out
for copyright reasons in a game that's
30 years old I don't know that could be
well I'm I will I will double check
something else I will look it up rich
don't worry here it is I found it maybe
I got a rich doing you sure I got it
because I know from GOG I've got all
this stuff in a fold around here
somewhere oh sure I'm gonna find that
folder which is riveting screaming how
about that ghostbusters we're just gonna
have the fucking Wayne oh sure
the trailer was really bad the movie
looks really bad it's probably gonna be
it's another pointless rewrite that's
what that's what there is to save and
like that theme theme is great any hoes
great 30 years ago it's still great now
any hope I had of it being a decent
movies it was and by the way just a bad
trailer you were wrong to have that
whole I you know yes I was that one
wasn't really hope but it I was leaving
open the opportunity you were wrong
leaving of course I was wrong but I was
leaving open the opportunity and it
could it could have been good and it's
not but it could have been I think no of
course it could have it could have been
you know you don't remake Casablanca
you should remain Casablanca you remake
something that was kind of bad to begin
with but that had potential that's the
movie you remake I think I found it
no I did not
see where the names yours doesn't have
names either
coz I'm gonna do is go on us weird how
do you find the names are they seeing
this not this okay see that's what I had
open well some one of the chat is
probably found the name you think
you know what if I just said enter where
is it yes any mind you'll need to do
better there and the game closed itself
oh snap
great snap this is why you do prefer
work somebody's saying well I assume
that the manual that's supposed to have
this information would have this
information yeah baby that was stupid
we have the manual and it says to look
at the manual for the information and
it's not in there so someone saying
Jones well it's gonna be a different
name now because the game closed itself
okay yeah here we go okay here that
hotness
what that's it oh that's horrifying
that's horrifying oh my god hold on
someone just gave us a tip hold on
anonymous now that you have a 3ds so
you're gonna stream Majora's Mask since
the version doesn't have an ugly
character model for link maybe we now we
now have a 3ds my 3s came I tweeted this
my 3ds with the capture card came the
very day that I was here complaining
that it hadn't come yet it was waiting
for me when I got home and by the way I
tested it out and it's it's like a
little USB connection and it is lagless
capture one year is bad since detective
city bonds exceptionally brought Jesse
Baines the Death Angel to justice my
world of rapid drugs and open violence
the world he controlled so well has been
silenced
now his veins whatever as the memory of
this animals slowly fades the city of
Lytton once again lives in the peace and
serenity of its best officer Sonny bonds
B has been promoted to the position of
homicide detective today begins with me
writing for another routine work day or
so it seems
Oh James Oh Oh hold on Jones this Jones
but someone also gave us a URL which I
think has this oh yeah hey Jones fuckin
sweet now we can actually fucking real
properly start thank you whoever sent us
that Santa is that alright that's not my
screen is missing Oh oh my god 25 thing
which is bad oh there yeah we're gonna
need that there's information up there
yes okay how do we fix this that's
picture size is that in here yeah
no no no no no that's just the way it
wants to display that's just the way it
great
friggin there we go let's do it let's do
it
all the time so what am i doing look
around to the menu on my TV is in my way
yeah behind I'm behind the will of my
personal car Marie that's the prostitute
I married at the end of the last game
talked me into trading in my sports car
for this sensible compact model stupid
wife already I already regret this
marriage what the hell am i doing that a
whore tell me what kind of drive a nice
manly car before and I'm driving this
sissy vehicle I'm happy because she lets
me stick it in places I didn't think she
would that's a great the one advantage
to marrying a prostitute you can put it
anywhere literally any way
hey baby bring that elbow over here mmm
you ever had a woman sneeze come on your
balls I have it wasn't as nice as I
thought it would be quite frankly what
it why did you think it would be nice
why don't you think that would be nice
that's weird how do I get his car yes
yes let me make sure the keys are out of
the ignition that would be wise the text
isn't severe I take the keys for my
ignition so that was a smart thing to do
I got a point for that it made a noise
yeah there you go
I'm uh-oh they can see it all like they
can see the topic no good my Ken yeah
you guys can see it you guys can see
everything you guys can see everything

why the hell would that not display I
have no idea yeah you guys cannot see
the text boxes that's weird
what the fuck that's really weird I
can't even understand that yeah yeah
does that show up are we gonna have to
do a thing where where we will see we
have to just watch it small and do a
screen capture we can do that we've done
that before I think I think that's how
we had to play it last time you just do
a screen capture like that disable vsync
ah you have a solution yes I have a
janky solution rich has a janky xela

unmarked cars private cars and sometimes
a mock police cruiser there you go
you're in the I am in the parking lot of
litmus newly remodeled police station
this is the detectives entrance oh
that's why it's locked like there's a
main entrance it makes some lot of sense
i unlock and open the door but I don't
like it behind me because I don't give
no fucks look around the hell if someone
are we looking at this through a
peephole yes
I mean Linton's newly remodeled police
station I'd like to keep said keep
reminding myself that it's been
remodeled because I I'm constantly
getting lost I think I'm in the old
police station but that's God now they
turn it down I think they put up weapons
at a Taco Bell Taco Bell
I'm fine American food that's really
Mexican but we made it our own because
that's what we Americans do we invade
and take over and make things our own we
turn on American things in the good
old-fashioned American Pie my making it
blend mass-produced
this is the hall there's several doors a
coda and an evidence window okay yes I'm
gonna walk into this door because hey
it's a door oh oh god oh Jesus hello
people
the NAG annex office is equipped with
five deaths of file cabinet and various
items hanging on the wall and what of
the desk is a computer this is how but
this is this is mechanics which is not
my department so I'm just gonna mosey on
out hey rich
yes fisted buy dope smoke I wanted to
give us a tip wanting to know if we
could move our faces to the other side
of the screen so that they can see
what's being typed in a text box also
that's not a bad idea
I like that suggestion that was worth $2
you get the sunny bonds seal of approval
okay I've seen that it right it's
easy-peasy
now it'll be a little weird because when
we're watching the game we're gonna be
kind of looking off screen but that's
fine that's fine whatever whatever hi
everybody
look around okay
what good but you know we don't need to
see yes I was distracting you it's
distracting me seeing me yes look around
I need to I need to say out loud what
I'm going to see and do and yeah this is
the homicide office which I should know
I work here every day the homicide
office is equipped with five deaths file
cabinet a locker and various other items
hanging on the wall on whether than one
of the desk is a computer or computer
like one of those fancy things that I
don't trust one of those fancy comp you
traitors like in my day we use the paper
and pen and that's all we needed look at
computron that they're gonna walk closer
but my partner Keith takes a deep puff
and says
they say sorry I heard that dirtbag you
sent up the river last year's back in
town for a retrial in their name Baynes
something like that I'm gonna point out
a couple things not that I don't
disapprove of that voice from it's kind
of a mobster voice which is an
interesting choice for a a cop detective
partner and this is this is now this is
the opportunity for the goofiest team up
in the world
this really is secondly you're probably
gonna be doing this voice a lot yeah as
this is the partner Jesus so I want you
to keep that in mind
hmm well buddy's a smoker
right so he needs to have a little gruff
voice maybe it maybe I'll do Columbo for
him then you know um yeah yeah say Sonny
I heard that dirtbag you sent up the
river last year back in town for retrial
his name our Baynes
you just got remind me what his name is
what did they you can do babe his name
was babe oh yeah that's what I thought I
was talking to my wife the other day and
I told it at yeah not on the screen I
think this is still your oh maybe this
time I you could put them away for the
duration huh it just seems like the
garbage of this world gets gets every
chance known to man no that's good
that's good oh that desk is a computer
look at the computer you might add oh my
god it's got a separate screen oh Jesus
apparently cierra computer games famous
for making just simple adventure games
apparently they've made their own
computer that's probably a piece of shit
they can only run Sierra game you know
they run Sierra games poorly the device
that just runs games
why what a horribly unsuccessful idea
that would be you're throwing your money
down the toilet by buying a thing that
only plays games
no one's gonna want one games are a
waste of time and I love nothing to do
with them
Arnold Rimmer says stoke me a clipper oh
my god I'll be back for Christmas this
thing runs on command prompts when where
does this nut I can't click on anything
because where it does I've just had a
flashback use the computer to play
police quest to do it run police quest
to see : command
run no there's something for searching I
forget what it is oh well oh god I don't
know ok I miss my bunch of other people
I don't know how to use this newfangled
device it's it's too new and innovative

established because she's a whore she's
good because she's a whore

Kickstarter to support this dream barn
we missed her chance looking at the
board I'm looking to the board at board

board I scan the bulletin board and see

a rack of khakis the shooting schedule
indicates that I am behind on my scores

look at your filth you're a poor excuse
for a cop you just leave your trash all
over the floor with a perfectly good
unused waste paper basket right next to
it
what is wrong I can't appreciate you
what is wrong with you
the burglary office bunch of goofs
bottom feeders is furnished with regular
stuff because that's all they deserve
bulletin board deaths of wall lamp a
bookcase and a computer
hold on anonymous oh damn yes I'm
getting a rekt yeah
wait you probably need to talk need to
talk to him done first I'm just gay gets
so excited then it's anonymous with like
say dear rlm keep an eye out in the
future for Netflix's altered carbon it's
based off of a favorite book of mine
same title about a body swapping super
soldier surrounded by conspiracy and
murder
ok ok anonymous altered carbon also hey
you hack frauds do you grind your own
coffee beans I do yes always always
grind your own because then you can get
then it stays fresher longer and you can
get the exact right make sure I give the
next male character a Donald Trump voice
don't forget to add tremendously before
every other abject adjectives ok great
I will do so this is the shooting range
each officer is expected to maintain a
proficient level in weapons training
I see weapons officer get Mills standing
behind the equipment counter hello Ken
says up here's what I want to say to you
what's the game plan fella
not a great trump but a tremendously
important one I'm not sure what you want
me to do so I'm just going to do
everything alright
ask for a gun so I have a gun which mine
what's my inventory inventory I am
carrying a keyring a money clip
thank-you letter well it at an LPD
business guy you do not have a gun the
guns in here I probably have to go to my
locker and get a gun oh I'm getting my
gum you know I know you Sierra games I
know if I walk into that shooting range
I'm prepared
I'm probably accidentally gonna get shot
as something so you don't know I'm not
ignorant
they're real consequences consequences
for actions in this world and by the way
crows teeth yes I am I am 100% confirmed
coffee snob huge coffees now
I'm gonna look around now the lack of
room has three rows full-sized lockers
two benches a wash basin with mirror and
ford toilet stalls I wait take a moment
save a game nice girl save your game the
chat is reminding us I might I might
accidentally open up at the door and see
somebody's Wang and that'd make me gay
we wouldn't want that and then it's game
over it is game over forever
you know that's what happens if you see
another man's Wang right you turn into a
game and then it's just game over
automatically you can't vote you can't
get married to a woman immediately it's
like you see another man's Wang and and
animalistic bloodlust comes over a cock
loss what do you mean the gays can vote
now what is America good to back in my
day you had to bring your wife to the
voting booth have intercourse with her
to prove you could vote to completion
which was a which lock is yours I'm
looking for the one that's just any
bonus market probably over here alright
sure
the name on this vac rocker Lakha reads
s bonds on this rocker fine not a
substantive name I'm very proud of it
telecom wants to make sure by the way
that we do make at least one character
sound like Dan or Don Wilson okay we'll
see well we'll say me if a character
fits the bill
I've done Wilson I think I just when I
do that I think that has to be just
complete improv I don't know if I could
read lines like that it wouldn't have
the same energy
you wouldn't know well you know what but
if we see if maybe a character is loud
and boisterous and Don's whole thing
goes he'd go anywhere right listen we'll
see what's the first numbers become
assuming it's in the manual oh God but
I'm not sure hold on I have the manual
I'm gonna I have the manual you're right
I'm gonna search my wallet maybe it's in
there radio codes vehicle codes in the
back of my wallet I find my scuba diving
certificate so I think we can assume
that's going to come into play oh I got
a point for that that was a good thing I
did barely apparently read my business
guy it says LBD sunny buds detective oh
there actually is a whole computer
procedures the thing in here oh nice
you're looking at the shooting range
procedures too okay well this is all
very good this is all very you're gonna
use that shooting range but I need to
get my gun that's gonna be in the locker
and I need to open the locker
so it's either in the manual or I have
to find this in the world somewhere
maybe in the world I'm checking the
manual what would good old-fashioned
American luck accommodate should be Y 1
2 3 4 of course 1 2 3
better try again ok I say I told you I'm
getting the Alzheimer's I have to see a
doctor immediately after I bust some
bugs because that comes first busting
Punk's that's the life of a cap in the
streets and the filth
I'm sorry what the who the what in the
who
cavitation what's another American
number twelve twelve is a good artist
number I like it
well-rounded and second number is gonna
be something even four four and then and
then zero for the third number because
we don't need a third it's a waste of
space I don't agree with it a third

we yes LPD Sonny bonds detective
turnover card oh my god Jackie is some
kind of amazing genius I'm just saying
what wasn't up 36 for 12 oh my god they
were I thought you were being crazy a
crazy person with the whole two-digit
number thing there you go there you go
boom who's that talk to him we were kind
of right what we added 12 and a for just
another right order we don't have 36
that's true
look at mad look at man talk to man
hello man I watched as traffic officer
Mario Gillespie books evidence the only
thing lower than a burglary officer is a
traffic officer an Italian traffic
Italian traffic officer we're keeping an
eye on you
just seppies sippy what whatever you
booking the spaghetti in evidence again
you get out yeah yeah I can you can bet
your wires temps 36 boom four boom 12
boom ooh
and of course I have a picture of a
woman yes a fine woman too good to
remind you constantly of your
heterosexuality the rejected I put her
in her place the kitchen where she could
make me a sandwich while I put up this
poster of a half-naked woman she cried
but that just meant she knew what was up
that is my wife Alzheimer's I forgot I
look at this picture at the beach
Maria's sighted love Marie what a girl
look at look at the gams on that girl
right there
and look at that that's my gun that's
the real beauty in this scene look at
gun my luck it contains my handgun extra
ammo clips and handcuffs look at looking
and that need to use the word logically
in this game because that is just too
much emotion has far too much emotion
and you're right I need to really did
keep it on the inside rich you love your
gun we know this my gun and holster are
on a hook get guns yeah Oh ammo try to
conceal erection get backups bend over
to slightly conceal your erect penis
boom
what are they what are they gonna
receive
Oh gun range procedures I'm on it I'm on
it I'm on it okay shooting around
procedures you have to type load gun or
use the function key listed in a
pulldown menu to load your gun type
raise gun to and then use the
directional keys to adjust your aim type
fire gun
if the sights on your gun need to be
adjusted type adjust sights I'm assuming
we'll need to adjust our sights use the
arrow keys to adjust the windage and
elevation screws each time you press an
arrow key the windage or elevation
screws will rotate one position with a
little practice you can improve load
gudden raise gun aim okay header heart
heart go for the heart that's the kill
shot by a gun that was the procedure
right I didn't I didn't mess that up
you got that by the book I should
protect my ears god damn it there's no
there's nothing in here about protection
areas you got to go talk to that guy
maybe there here a shelf beneath the
table holds extra targets the target is
positioned by the buttons on the left
wall that's fine
exits isn't it there's nothing in here
about protection it probably does I say
I have Alzheimer's I don't remember
these things that I should know because
I come here every day and knowing me I
almost certainly fire my gun off every
day mr. goat says stick fingers in here
then raise gun Oh Trump hmm all right
I'm gonna give you this ear protection I
just need you to return them when you're
through because we're turning them is
what makes this police station great if
I remember to remember all scientists
this is what's gonna happen
plug ears with gun
okay so we're probably have to adjust
the size use protection I thought that
sickens me okay
your gun looks huge I don't think I'll
need to load it again but we'll see
checking my gun I see that the clip is
not yet empty and so I do not reload as
that would make no sense raise gun okay
raise gun yeah so now make sure that
your aim sights are somewhere that you
can replicate so like lower lower than a
little bit right there so like it's it's
on the let it's on the skinny at the
very highest skinny one so then we can
adjust aim as necessary
firing fun buy buy a gun Oh gun of
course you have fun you will not need to
use the word fun in this game once again
I got too emotional let me let me really
back real bad you could fun is not in
this game's dictionary fire
Oh God that felt good fire my god again
and again and again fuck yeah ok ok
let's take a look let's take a look
lower your gun fire gun Oh like click
Gloria gun now let's check on your
target oh no you need to press the
button to brace do you want me to be on
the streets later to have some punk gun
me down because I was out of ammunition
right push my bottom button sure no I'm
a man I'm gonna push the top button or
you could look at the buttons maybe to
see you and your logic let's see which
one says which there two buttons on the
wall of the booth
what is labeled view and the other is
labeled back let's view yeah that's way
off ok shut is on you are up and to the
left my gut is shooting high into the
left you were correct your assessment
system let's just sites just sites you
screw ok so wait
use the arrow keys to agile the windage
and elevation screws each time you press
an arrow key the windage or elevation
screw will rotate one position so you
want to you want to lower elevation one
good that's it
and you want to which way does it go I
don't know two more yeah yeah okay okay
good
and so now try firing and see if we're
closer but I miss rich yep enter the
nude code by opening the console and
typing some stuff no okay no no what are
you some kind of hippie wear clothes
like an American comb your hair okay
raise gun
boom okay never again let's just let's
check it out
my shit modern games don't do this
that's right this is awesome and I'm
sure there's gonna be something later
where we need to be really we're still
awesome we didn't do it near enough oh
well shit
well shit you're right rich go into
overwatch
okay yeah check it out checkout it
coming
two bad cats is coming next month on
steam gun a sight adjustment simulator I
would believe that yeah bear simulator
fine with us no I think this is great
and this is probably gonna come in handy
later like maybe have to shoot at
someone and and if we're not super
accurate right hey I think we're good
enough is that where you were aiming I
just needed to do it a lot more and I
did okay you set my sights up properly
aligned boom

from the office 5:3 berry to 10-4 will
copy are you on route to Litton City
Journal
a suniye this escape has got to be a
real nightmare for you on the other hand
it must be a super nightmare for that
poor correctional officer yeah yeah well
partner yeah I guess this mean that that
the that the unspeakable Asterix symbols
has really hit the fan
I should hope Baines let that correction
officer go on oh you know I'm saying
it'd be a shame just a just a shame if
anything happened to I did this past
five to remarry to 1097 let in City Jail
yeah that's where I'm gonna shoot don't
you glove you want with an easier voice
throat five three very tool ten-four no
1097 City Jail finally I you you go
ahead son I'm gonna study a bit have a
smoke
it's gonna be great so yeah so by the
way let's just comment a little bit yeah
the mostly BS thing of having to do that
one very specific really you should not
have been able to go into the fire I
agree
until you were able to do that things
just I agree yes I'll still take it over
point-and-click sure can just click on
things your stalker rather than at least
having to think a little bit well maybe
I should do this but after that
so I'm going to look around now this is
the underground parking garage of the
new living city jail because apparently
they rebuilt the entire city after the
last game everything nothing was good
enough anymore after I put this town on
the map there was such an influx of new
income after you put the angel of death
or the death angel actually there was a
horrible D it could come after that
because that drug trade that was really
keeping the city alive all the drugs and
all the drugs flow into this town named
after the local businesses they spent a
ton of money I really I put the whole
city into an economic crisis we have
where'd the money to rebuild all this
stuff when the President of the United
States god bless his soul gave us
emergency funds to save the town from
from certain disaster I'm filled with
pride as the memories of the dedication
ceremonies returned the dedication
ceremonies to this jail well we'll put
all of the poor people so they won't be
able to bother us nice normal folks
anymore I also have a sneaking suspicion
again that someone's watching me
perhaps through a people of some kind a
rusty peephole it's much easier when you
don't have to draw everything all the
way out into the edges of the frame it
is a time-saving measure because we need
to be efficient
I appreciate efficiency following my
heroic capture of Jessie Bane's aka The
Death Angel boom I became an instant
celebrity after plunging the town into
an economic disaster but now unless I
recapture Bane's only the bitter bitter
memories of failures will remain
dun-dun-dun look at wall I'm gonna look
at this wall now oh I see gutting
lockers built into the gun creed wall
next to a heavy metal door and I don't
appreciate heavy metal
that I don't like anything more risque
than the Beach Boys even them ahead
sound even though I wouldn't ask I'll
make a noise good animals in quiet
less the dogs barking and criminals
sometimes stand up everybody to
understand I've been an hour it's time
to stand up there appears to be a
built-in video camera surveillance
system and a speaker on the wall above
the door there was a button to the right
of the door wouldn't it be nice if we
were older it's not about being nice
it's about doing a civic duty doing this
for your home
take a little break coming any more
water
wouldn't it be nice if we were older
that we wouldn't have to write so learn
it's for your health your health it's
important I feel since I've started
standing up every hour on the stream I
feel so much better afterwards
boom started the timer again you know
like you sit down for just four hours
straight and then you you get up and and
it just it just hurts what's sad
which rich is really sad because there's
just one slice of cheese left in the
kitchen you went to make a sandwich and
there's only one slice of cheese which
is very sad about that so
I stood up to grab a new beer that's
fine you stood up that's all that
matters
that's all that matters no this this
laptop is not a Mac it's a it's an old
Windows laptop that I had at home and I
brought it here so I wouldn't have to
bring in my laptop all the time
we need a longer intermission to get
more cheese yeah
there hasn't been you know like we've
just been playing the game as what
usually happens when we play police
quest it's more you know it actually
holds our attention so there's been less
conversation to catch everybody up
Ghostbusters the remake is gonna suck
that's okay movies suck are you gonna
eat a cheese sandwich live on stream Oh
Oh sputters I love that Bill Murray
that's a funny man it was it was very it
was very sad on Saturday Lisa and I went
to a party and we were all discussing
the Ghostbusters trailer and everybody
was in agreement like oh my god no just
no good can come from this and we we
started discussing you know like the
problems with the trailer and like how
it really didn't compare to the first
one and then it was just like we need to
go watch the first one I'm like I
quickly looked it up online like where I
could get like a blu-ray copy of
ghostbusters oh they ever they've won at
Best Buy's it's in stock right now we'll
stop on the way and then some work stuff
came up so we weren't able to watch the
Ghostbusters on Saturday and that was
really sad I'm sorry you know I do all I
want to do now is watch ghostbusters you
know the sandwich would be delicious
with more cheese on it or something but
they haven't we have got a clue small
Skelton you did you just missed stand-up
time but there's still time stand-up now
we just got back from stand-up time we
are now sitting again taking a little
break staring at a wall while rich eats
a cheese sandwich so
I know we're not progressing very fast
into the game yeah but is the return of
Sunday bonds is it living up to
expectations
this is everything you would hope for
everything everybody hoped for rich I
know it to be true
I know it to be true I don't know if
people will go see the new Ghostbusters
movie the what was what was the other
movie that just bombed recently the
remake the the gem in the Holograms
movie big stars big names nobody care
about jamming the Holograms in the first
place this is not a remake really it's
it well it's a it's a nostalgia property
with with big names in it did not do
very well fairly worthless nostalgia
property just saying Robocop's a better
comparison Robocop the Robocop bomber is
it just for I'm not sure it's definitely
forgotten about well oh yeah it's that
one forgotten hold on I'm gonna I'm
gonna look up the numbers for Robocop

wash down that mostly bread sandwich
without really ugly can of Diet Coke I
mean really this is just an ugly ugly
can mostly bread sandwich well says Jose
Pedulla not much I think he's a foreign
director how's that Pedulla you don't
expect to have Americans have more
common sense these days Americans did
have more you don't expect it though oh
you don't expect expect it okay yeah I
mean so Americans didn't go see the
Robocop remake yeah that's something
maybe the real dumb fat people are in
Europe from yeah we have cheese and wine

Hayes car I sure hope he's okay poor kid
he's just a rookie in the height
I haven't haven't had it heck we just
put together a file on Baynes this
morning and he's gone already
what was I supposed to do ask about file
that's not a clear sentence but in video
game logic it should work ask file why
do you ask a file which for how do you
want to look at I mean I know we were
just talking about Baynes and how we
just finished the file on Baynes but if
you could be more specific it what file
you want to look at maybe the Baynes
are you a more at audible I'm borderline
underachieving in all my academic
classes I've been a cop for 21 years and
I've never seen anyone quite as stupid
as you if it helps I was raised in a
paint factory bank when I became a cop
you had to pass a test then if you
weren't smart enough you didn't pass the
test and they'd beat you with rocks I'm
not a cop I'm a jailor it's my job to
make sure the door is closed I'm feeling
a strong urge to take you out back and
beat you with rocks
I would I would suggest
that I don't like rocks unfortunately
that's illegal for some reason it's
gonna this sucks so much files you want
to look at Bane's unbelievable
fucking un-fuckin'-believable I can't
believe the things that I'm saying
Oh Aki file files have to say yes give
him back before you leave what happened
to his head he's turning into a girl
he's turning into a hippie or a hippie a
girl able to the same thing really
ultimately there's no difference between
a woman and a hippie except cooking
hippies don't know how to cook no the
raw food we're gonna have to we're gonna
have to round up all the hippies and
teach them how to cook okay let's see

I enjoyed the nerdy chat about
narratives thanks thank you thank you
fun time last we did we do we twit that
right yeah we tweeted similar it is
people might not might not be hip to the
twits I know I'm not for anyone who
doesn't follow us on the Twitter nerdy
Inc a YouTube channel I had a nice
conversation with us about storytelling
and games and the video just came out I
wanna say yesterday or whenever i
retweeted their tweet about the video
and it was really fun it's like a
45-minute hour long discussion just rich
and me and the two guys from nerdy Inc
talking about story and video game is
quite a quite a fun time we're done it
was good turned out well um what's your
opinion on ghostbusters 3 story games
based on established worlds can tell
good stories like DC Universe Online for
the ps1 it's radio Fox
I didn't play ghostbusters 3 oh the game
oh the game yeah the Ghostbusters the
the recent one 3d one great yeah it's
great
we should play that oh we can't stream
it well we can technically but it's very
dialogue heavy and it's dialogue by Bill
Murray dan Aykroyd inhaled Ramos we
don't want to talk over that I don't
want to talk over that okay this is like
no point and streaming it just find it
and play it yeah oh but no you're right
van Belding it is just audio it is
there's no video it is just us talking
so like it's a youtube video but just
put
in the background and it's it's
basically a podcast so we figured out
what we need to do oh hold on
oh whoa gonna get caught up this first
games mm that sounds an awful lot like
Bane's
I've got my eye on you spectacularly
sick this evening nothing better than
hard-boiled Sonny bonds and Edith bunker
to lift my spirits that that the classic
crime-fighting duo right there Sonny
bombs and Edith bunker Oh Sammy I don't
think we're in the right neighborhood
knows what a day's rich really doesn't
want to give Ernie Hudson winston
zeddemore any credit that's the second
time he's left him out because he's
relatively unimportant I'm sorry I know
Winston has his fans I don't hate the
character I don't hate Ernie Hudson
yeah but ghostbusters is a classic
because of Bill Murray Harold Ramis and
Dan Aykroyd also you could replace Ernie
Hudson with a lot of different actors
and it wouldn't change the movie at all
Ernie Hudson's great he's great in the
movie replace him with Eddie Murphy and
you've got a better movie probably well
the character actually is the straight
man so let's see that's the thing about
his character he is the audience avatar
right he's supposed to be uninteresting
and unimportant
he's the information sponge right okay
so they can dump like how all the
equipment works as a site I also think
it's just kind of a joke that you know
with for most of the movie like 2/3 of
the movie we have our established guys
and these are our main characters and
then all of a sudden there's just like
employee with them it is this out of
place guy who's just there for the money
right you got work for me this is great
it's just there I will believe in
whatever you tell me to if there's a
paycheck in it that's that's how he's
not a terrible character he's just not
an essential ingredient to the magic
you could replace that met character
that Ernie Hudson even then even the
character you could was hurting Hudson a
lot of different actors who could just
be a straight man
yeah and it's fine but it's just fine
but Ernie Hudson does a great job yeah I
never said he did a bad job never said
he did a bad job why do you hate her and
Hudson so much extremes everything's
gonna stream everything's a fucking
extreme the Tigers Kirk Winston was
conceived as Eddie Murphy Aykroyd wrote
the character for Murphy after doing
trading places with him Winston was
supposed to be the best Ghostbuster he
had more science training and was a
marine but they needed an every man
without Winston they're not crying about
absolutely.i I've heard that like you
know his character was supposed to be
this huge part of but no you need to be
do you think the movie is terrible
before Winston shows up and to do you
think that Ernie Hudson is the only
person who could have done this job
those are the two things I want to ask -
yep yep welcome to the Internet okay
great but back to the back of the thing
Oh oh yeah you figured out what hey I
asked about Pete no there's another file
on paint because the chiller is an idiot
it didn't think to do this in the first
place here's a line motherfucker oh oh
yeah you want to look at paints fine
I'll go get it for ya oh yeah that makes
a lot of sense
you mean the guy who is kidnapped you
want to know about him too weird you
know bands the fantasy here's a map for
you Louise you spit you can't take well
let's see if there's maybe important
information on her what do we got
let's get her let's get our handy-dandy
notebook I mean sono alias nice date of
birth these things might be might be
useful like we gotta wait out we're
gonna ready a call male 511 black brown
hair found a ditch and oh that's
probably paid yeah yeah but then we
don't need information well we don't
remember just write down what do you
want date of birth birth Wow

corrections officer what is what a stat
probation mean I don't know that weird

to get further in nope okay great
definitely don't want to forget my guts
your gun I mean any updates of the
Winston's situation
Oh ghost was removing an Amazon Prime
video with it maybe I'll watch that like
I'd like to get you know what I'd and
actually the Best Buy has like a
Ghostbusters 1 & 2 on blu-ray but it
didn't have any special features behind
besides like that a dan Aykroyd and
Harold Ramis roundtable discussion which
could be great and I'd like a nice
blu-ray like some commentary behind the
scenes shit you know

Oak Tree Mall the city's newest location
for shopping convenience because
apparently everything is brand new

used to be around a year ago we tore the
whole city down the memories of the
Death Angel were that they were just too
painful everyone was so sad once the
loss of the the economy happened after
he got taken down by me that we just had
to start from scratch

[Part IV]
okay do you need your sure you're on it
already I just want to know which one's
the right car that's that that's a lot
one oh I'm suing this is this red one
you got the kit yeah I would also assume
it's the red one use camera camera
fingerprint brush okay we didn't get any
points for that
not worth processing you think
we're because they found the car right
yeah one of these is the jailers car
maybe it's the blue one but that was
such a comical what a nice car stuff you
know that seems weird
fine-looking machine you'll find
anything interesting I don't want to
open my car door
did you try you the fingerprint thing
again all right all right all right okay
try the fingerprint thing on the blue
car
processing
plastic bag casting casting plaster why
would you need that I don't know I think
I've been prouder finger brush
fingerprint tape hold on let me look at
some procedure here yeah yeah
all right let's see here homicide
investigation procedures perhaps well
some homicide detective must have reason
to believe a crime has been committed by
one or more of the following personal
observation statements from a witness or
conclusive or circumstantial evidence
now Oh a chat is saying it is the blue
Corvette by the way okay
did you radio that where you were here
you look but it doesn't hold your
interest that's why you're here oh yeah
it's open that door the other door what
nothing they only drew one picture
that's annoying
they only drew one picture that's not
that's a little annoying that isn't Oh
Ciara
search car yeah yeah that's fine okay
look under seat glovebox
yep okay okay okay okay I look in the
glove compartment and see boots an empty
holster and guy registration Oh
done done to confirming the name Louie
paint lousy French name I returned to
the glove box awesome
well let's look at holster I look at the
empty holster and ponder the whereabouts
of the gun I've retained it for evidence
boom what bullets put holster in bag
then why would I want to put you know
what that's just a suggestion that you
put the evidence in the evidence bag I'm
just gonna hold it with my hands and my
fingers with all of my my sticky
fingerprints you know I was just eating
Cheetos another orange fingerprints for
me all over this holster bright orange
fingerprints from me
I'm just bearing it all around because
I'm holding it in my hand
my hands are really sweaty - this can't
be good Freddy pre-existing fingerprints
that were on the holster did you did you
dust the holster did you powder the
holster rich that was next yeah give it
time
doesn't type yeah looking at the
ammunition over I think hmm three rounds
of 38 caliber better hang on to these
down for evidence for ever done past 38
caliber you know there's that decide you
know it's not 50
I can't imagine you would have a 50
caliber handgun hey what else is there
to do look at box again did you pow
fingerprint the box we looked through
the registration all right pose about is
there a procedure for crying just
general crime scene investigation don't
think so use powder add box carefully
you apply the dust and mumbling to
yourself this print is too smudged to
take oh yeah yeah well it is get is
coated with cheeto dust now it probably
did that help Hey look at kit what's it
well this is my kid plastic baggie
baggie camera use camera I want to be a
good police officer I take a picture and
return the camera to my field kit there
is um there's felony arrest procedures
and homicide investigation procedures
homicide investigation okay Oh kind of
sound we got a beat be to be because we
got some evidence now yep Lowe's box not
sure close yeah box not sure
finding nothing my mistakes tell me
we're not done well we found we found
some holster and some bullets and we we
messed up a fingerprint thing but that's
fine
oh the jailors empty gun holster you
have no no I have no reason to put him
in since Becky would just be insane
you've already touched it rich the
registration automatically went back in
so I'll try it again oh oh I don't think
we need to get that yeah well he puts it
back all right jack what do you got what
do you got
I do you think we're done believe we got
two pieces of evidence we haven't been
able to fingerprint anything which is
the only other thing we have we're safe
we're saying oh they're saying look at
it look at what the registration did
that open the box what's it what's in
the box
okay that's it that's the same thing we
do that three times okay
no just yeah they're double-checking now
you know what that's a fine thing try to
try to powder knowledge junkie says
powder door handle gearshift center
console yeah nope I'm doubting central
console yeah you already tried okay okay

Keith listening me I hear some good

have casting plaster oh my god we get to
use it oh my god we get to use our
casting plaster I'm so excited I have to
interrupt this woman because she's you
talk very loudly in general I suppose I
do
and when you do the woman voice you
scream so we're away from it I had
tempted her up because she's blathering
on she keeps rolling it out and she says
I get scared when I heard the brush
crack so I ran down here and called the
police

there's no specific procedure here we're
you know like there's a homicide
investigation procedures the detective
must have reason to believe a crime
crime has been committed by one or more
of the following personal observation
statements of a witness conclusive
and/or circumstantial evidence right
mm-hmm assess the situation use extreme
caution during initial investigation be
on alert for possible life-threatening
situations be ready to take appropriate
actions Oh
although shaking from surprised
confusion and fear I somehow managed to
return fire with us none of this can be
right I don't know what fear means I've
never felt fear before there's an alien
emotion I only don't cold hard gun metal
okay although the flight of my bullet
misses its target comes close enough to
cause the suspect to take leg and bail
or to take a leg bail get up you'll not
need to use the word M in this game
hey Bri brings like memorizing you okay
let's shoot whoa
Rawdon what's wrong with my legs oh
there he goes
okay this games like a mafia informant
oh my god I never I never saw no car
don't know what you're talking about
okay you keep saying it was a car around
here but I don't even know what you're
talking about Jesus but what looking
gavage well we should report this right
yeah bro it's Keith's gonna talk to you
you have no reason to do that I'm not
sure what you want me to do okay
shoot key this what I want you to do
I'm with you Sonny actually you were I
was I was chasing the bad guy yeah and
then when I when I when I had to double
back cuz he drove away I walked over
here and you just like hanging out
around here yeah you guns that drawn
you're not shooting at punks I was
watching uh I was watching two ducks
swimming in the river it it filled my
life with meaning for a moment that's
all I was doing
that's a holster gun which I guess it
makes sense nope it's got a keep you got
out now I'm good man you are going down
gunman as suspected I look in the
garbage can and find garbage look at
blood
I think that's blood up there I'm not
sure but I'm gonna assume it is see
nothing with dead grass and ants well
fine you're not close enough near the
river's edge I looked down and see what
appear to be partially coagulated blood
and drag marks wats as you see
footprints in the soft damp ground I
inspect the evidence keep ambles into
view slowly without his gun drawn
Lelaina his partner who was just in
mortal danger I look at being snuffed
that poor jailer and then threw his body
into the river could you put up a body
string he must be working out in jail
doing something now you take care of
evidence I'll go radio request for the
UH that what you call it out when you go
when you when you go into the suit and
you got the mask can you go into the
water for a long time but you can still
breathe when you're under the water
scuba yeah one of them videos cool buzz
get conceived me one of them I'm sorry
I'm high right now
should not have smoked all that grass on
the
you know what do you call it when
they're the people go into boxes with
the with the bars I know I never did
lock the doors don't let him out cuz I
did bad stuff when we were dad smoked a
lot of pot nope nope get kid digger
thing kind of fun okay how can you get
kit whoo hey go alright okay cat use
casting + or maybe help buddies gonna
well I drop her
oh and boof
I use the eyedropper to collect the
sample of the coagulated blood and put
it into the glass vial nice I returned
the eyedropper to the kit and had the
vial of blood to my inventory of
evidence boom that's fuckin police work
use plaster on footprints
I removed the box of casting powder and
mixed the pod powder to the proper
consistency in part of the footprint
depression but if the liquid dries I
removed the impression of the footprint
and add it to my list of evidence boom
whole process took five hours also I
think I did this all while still holding
a gun we're gonna find out a moment
whenever I draw my gun I find it very
hard to put my gun away
not physically just mentally take a
picture
boom
nice call jack boom police work
remove pants shit on ground alright I
think that's that's everything then uh
yeah you tried looking around right it's
just like yep you did that all while
holding your gun that's that's amazing
police work is this just a glitch might
be demilitarize arm oh never seen Keith
move this fast ever what are you talking
about oh because it's moving very slow
maybe then I take the footprint sprint
it did say that right yeah you don't you
got to believe you for the footprints
check the finger prints on that blood
that's gonna work shit that's funny
like that holster gun does not work oh
that is it just went away it's God and
everything's fine look at phone booth
listen here shoot varmint telephone is
for the convenience of the public from
the looks of it has been well used and
abused used take all my prostitutes that
phone booth it's very uncomfortable for
them I liked it that way
doc - mad doctor obvious there's a
Gillespie yeah nobody wants to talk to
me right right here gob your friend I'm
gonna keep I'm gonna say to Sonny this
for your own benefit
you're kind of a boring conversation you
talk as if no one knows what a fucking
phone booth is you know there's the
diving team on Sonny you go ahead and
stand by the radio okay say spot the
Baines or something yeah basically what
I'm saying is go away from me right now
because Oh try to get on that diving
team you've got a scuba I'm sure that's
gonna be a thing you got a scuba hello
diving team will somebody talk to me
I'll be your friend

pain bond yes I was in Moore's in top
physical condition

you would like to ever come with me when
I work out I could use the inspiration
bones I like looking at men when I work
out it builds up the testosterone don't

wieners I like to look at the muscles
above and below the wieners if you look
at the wieners it turns you gay
little known fact about wieners didn't
know if you knew that bones if you just
look at the other muscle I mean who am I
talking to there's one dude here what
bonds where are you going I'm not done
talking about arenas and muscles bonds
what do you want to do game well what is
the proposed to stand by the ring but

hole the lovely establishment I've been
to they're a great martini selection
